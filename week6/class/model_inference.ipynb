With the new OSX 10.7 Lion, some of the plugins have updated views. PitchShift is one of these. </p>  <p>PitchShift and a few others have new knobs to change there parameters. When a knob is being turned with the mouse, a horizontal bar showing the knob's parameter value is displayed below the knob. </p>  <p>This bar stays on screen after the knob is released and even after the window is closed. If I click one of the knobs, thus creating a rogue value bar, and move the window the PitchShift view is in, the bar stays where the window used to be. And if I click the knob again at this point, a new bar appears, but both bars are actively updated with the changing knob parameter value information. This happens every time I repeat this process with more bars staying on screen.</p>  <p>After a few times with this happening, my app exits with bad access at  NSApplicaionMain() call in the main.m file. </p>  <p>I checked in Logic 9, and this does not happen there. The bar seems to be tied directly to the knob, and thus disappears immediately after you let the knob go with the mouse. </p>  <p>I set the PitchSHift view to be the contentView of a dedicated NSWindow.</p>  <p>How is Logic keeping this from happening, or just how can I? </p>  <p>I've tried seeing if the parameter value bars where subviews of the PitchShift view, but they don't seem to be. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT: When the a value bar first appears, I get the following output in the console from my program: Circle and line do not intersect</p>  <p>So I've found that it is using core-animations CALayers. The problem now is that the value bar layers aren't a part of the PitchShiftView's layer hierarchy. In other words, I can find all the other layers that build up the pitchShiftView, but not the layers for the value bars.

From what I've learned about statistics and cost estimation, using the two histograms above we can multiply the selectivity of SiteID (16005.02 / 286685) times the selectivity of DeleteDateTime (255827 / 286685) to get a composite selectivity of 0.0498187307480119.

I have seen several discussions on successful git branching models, unfortunately they are all very complicated for our case. Most of the branching models are suited for softwares with versions and release cycles.</p>  <p>Our company manages several web portals. We have 5 people working on these sites. Most of the time 2-3 people might be working on the same websites, but on different sections (chances of conflict are near zero). We don't have any versions or release cycles. A programmer will develop a particular section, after which it will be passed to another person, who will write content for the section and perform SEO. Once it is done, the section will be uploaded to the public website. In the mean time, another programmer might be working on updating an existing section. If a bug or error is reported, it will be fixed and uploaded immediately.</p>  <p>Usually, every week 2-3 new sections are added / updated.</p>  <p>Currently we have only one branch (master) and create a new branch only if the person is working on big change which will take more than 2 weeks to complete. The problem here is that the master branch is not in sync with the current production files. I would like to change this and move the development to another branch, so that bug fixes can be directly applied on the master branch without any worry.</p>  <p><b>Update</b> Is it bad to create a separate branch for each section?

Our client assembly, to be referenced from end user Visual Studio projects. Has strong references to the implementation dll's in the local installation folder.</li> </ul>  <p>In ClientAPI.dll, we have an entrypoint we require end user projects to invoke. Lets call it <code>Initialize()</code>.</p>  <p>The very first thing we do in <code>Initialize</code> is to install a so called <em>assembly resolve handler</em> on the current domain, using the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event. This handler will know how to locate the implementation dll's and load them into the client process, using <code>Assembly.Load()</code>.</p>  <p>Consider a console application. It will look something like:</p>  <pre><code>class Class1 {     void Main(string[] args)     {         ClientAPI.Initialize();          // Use other API's in the assembly, possibly internally referencing the         // implementation classes, that now will be resolved by our assembly         // resolve handler.     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Now, all is good in the console/windows forms/WPF world. Our assembly resolve handler is properly installed and invoked, and it can successfully resolve references to the implementation DLL's once ClientAPI.dll require their functionality.</p>  <p><strong>Problem statement</strong></p>  <p>With that being said, we intend not to support only console or WPF applications, so we were relying on the same design in ASP.NET. Hence, creating a new ASP.NET Web Application project in VS 2010, we figured everything would be as straightforward as:</p>  <pre><code>class Globals : HttpApplication {     void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         ClientAPI.Initialize();          // ...     } } </code></pre>  <p>A few 20-30 hours of dwelling in the ASP.NET runtime universe, trying the above in both the development server and in IIS, we've learned that things there are not really as we expected.</p>  <p>It turns out that in ASP.NET, as soon as the <code>ClientAPI</code> class is referenced anywhere, <em>all references it has to any other assemblies are instantly resolved</em>. And not only that: <em>the results are cached</em> (by design, since .NET 2.0 we've found), meaning we never have a chance at all trying to assist the CLR.</p>  <p>Without further elaboration about the different things we've tried and learned, it basically comes down to this question we have:</p>  <p>Why is ASP.NET resolving references like this? It is not compatible with how other types of applications does it, and even more, it is not according to the documentation of .NET / the CLR runtime, specifying that references to external types / assemblies are to be resolve when first needed (i.e when first used in code).</p>  <p>Any kind of insight/ideas would be highly appreciated!</p> </td><td><asp.net><gac><assembly-references><assemblyresolve></td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>You can goto \"\"Site Actions-->Site Settings-->Look and Feel-->Navigation-->Navigation Editing and Sorting\"\" to change its URL's case.</p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>95.0</td><td>pdf</td></tr><tr><td><pre><code>function bar(){}; console.log(bar.name); </code></pre>  <p>//Prints 'bar'</p>  <p>This works for functions only, not objects of any other type.</p>  <p>For a CoffeeScript class, you can do this</p>  <pre><code>class Foo f = new Foo console.log f.constructor.name #Prints 'Foo' </code></pre> </td><td>NULL</td><td>1.0</td><td>java</td></tr><tr><td><p>Here is my current rewrite rule</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^page/([^/\\.]+)/?$ index.php?page=$1 [L] RewriteRule ^post/([^/\\.]+)/?$ index.php?post=$1 [L] RewriteRule ^cat/([^/\\.]+)/?$ index.php?cat=$1 [L] </code></pre>  <p>three lines to do basically the same thing.

Hey, I've got the OO attributes down, so lets get to the methods :)</p>  <p>Note that I said 'best' way. I've already found two ways of doing it which also seem to be popular answers in similar questions, but they require circumventing strict and warnings respectively.</p>  <p>Note that the example gives the class-user the ability to override the formatting method at construction. Poor example, but you get the idea. To preemptively rebut the OO-purists, this makes more sense in my particular design than making the class-user subclass it with their own overridden version.</p>  <p>Here are my two attempts:</p>  <pre><code>use 5.014; use autodie; use strict; use warnings;  package Account {     use base 'Object::Accessor';      sub new {         my ($type, %args) = @_;          my $self = bless { }, $type;         $self-&gt;mk_accessors(qw(             first_name last_name age_in_years activated         ));          $self-&gt;first_name(  $args{first_name  } // 'Default First Name'  );         $self-&gt;last_name(   $args{last_name   } // 'Default Last Name'   );         $self-&gt;age_in_years($args{age_in_years} // 'Default Age in Years');         $self-&gt;activated(   $args{activated   } // 'Default Activated'   );          {             # Stop skim reading and look here!              no warnings 'once';             *formatted = $args{formatted} || sub {                 return 'Default formatting routine';             };         }          return $self;     } }  my $account = Account-&gt;new; say $account-&gt;formatted;  # Output: Default formatting routine </code></pre>  <p>And the other one:</p>  <pre><code>use 5.014; use autodie; use strict; use warnings;  package Account {     use base 'Object::Accessor';      sub new {         my ($type, %args) = @_;          my $self = bless { }, $type;         $self-&gt;mk_accessors(qw(             first_name last_name age_in_years activated         ));          $self-&gt;first_name(  $args{first_name  } // 'Default First Name'  );         $self-&gt;last_name(   $args{last_name   } // 'Default Last Name'   );         $self-&gt;age_in_years($args{age_in_years} // 'Default Age in Years');         $self-&gt;activated(   $args{activated   } // 'Default Activated'   );          {             # Stop skim reading and look here!              no strict 'refs';             *{'formatted'} = $args{formatted} || sub {                 return 'Default formatting routine';             };         }          return $self;     } }  my $account = Account-&gt;new; say $account-&gt;formatted;  # Output: Default formatting routine </code></pre>  <p>The former approach <strong>should</strong> work without warnings, but it doesn't because Perl thinks I'm not using it anywhere and flags it up as a warning at runtime. The latter doesn't work without circumventing strict, and that's how it should be :)</p>  <p>All I'm doing is assigning a method to a user-supplied coderef. There should be an easy way of doing this.</p>  <p>Note that defining a new sub that calls the user defined coderef doesn't work either, since the lexical %args can't be accessed from it.</p>  <p>Whilst our assigns package variables, it can't do subs.</p>  <p>Refraining the escape from the garden of strict and warnings, what is the cleanest way to do this?

If you call <code>Sleep</code> from the main thread, then the message queue will not be pumped until the timeout elapses.  Hence the entire app appears frozen.</p>  <p>Why does calling <code>Sleep</code> from one form affect another form? Because all GUI components are served from the single message queue of the main thread.  Once you stop pumping that queue, all GUI components stop receiving queued messages like <code>WM_PAINT</code>, <code>WM_KEYDOWN</code> etc.</p>  <p>As I understand it your problem is that your application appears hung when you are loading a 3MB text file into an edit control.  That size of file doesn't sound very large to me and one obvious solution would be to find an edit control that performs the load better.  For example I'm pretty sure that Notepad, Notepad++ etc. do not take steps like showing progress when loading such files. I rather suspect that those apps don't pump the queue when loading files but you just don't notice because of the short time taken.</p>  <p>What you don't want to happen is for you to pump your queue to keep your GUI responsive and in turn allow the user to start loading another file whilst the first one is still loading. You need to disable your UI whilst processing a load operation. A modal progress dialog is one way to do that.</p>  <p>If you can't switch to a better performing control, you could show a modal progress dialog and use a background thread like this. The background thread would have load the file in small chunks, say into a string list. After each chunk of the file was ready it would then call Synchronize and get the main thread to add the contents of the string list to the edit control, and then clear the string list. The thread would then continue and load the next chunk. Adding to the edit control in small chunks would allow you to keep the message queue serviced.</p>  <p>You could show progress in a status bar rather than a modal dialog which would be less intrusive.  But just remember to disable any UI that would cause re-entrant execution.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>4.0</td><td>php</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I've got class, let it be Foo:</p>  <pre><code>public class Foo {    ...    protected MyCollection&lt;Detail&gt; _details   public virtual MyCollection&lt;Detail&gt; Details    {      get { return _details ?? new MyCollection&lt;Details&gt;(); }      set { _details = value; ... }    }   ... }  public class Detail {...} </code></pre>  <p>When I do LINQ query:</p>  <pre><code>var q = session.Query&lt;Foo&gt;().Select(foo =&gt; new Foo( property1 = foo.property1, ... ); ... q.ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>I've got <strong>NULL</strong> in _details field, and <em>when I access to <strong>Details</em></strong> to get all <strong>Lazy</strong> details, of course I get <em>new MyCollection()</em>, but not IPersistentBag (or else, IPersistentCollection).</p>  <p>So How can I manually create proxy collection (I've got session / sessionFactory references)?</p>  <p>[ Added ] here is the mappings (on Foo):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;bag name=\"\"Details\"\" lazy=\"\"true\"\" collection-type=\"\"NHibernateDataService.DetailBag`1[[DataObjects.Detail</td><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>Good question but i think this is impossible. If there is some overlay inside the ControlTemplate you cannot formulate a function which calculates a darker colour which then will end up as the intended colour.</p>  <p>e.g. when you input red which is: <code>255,0,0</code> you get <code>255,153,153</code>, now the function that would need to be applied to your initial colour would need to darken the Red, this of course could only be done in the red channel as green and blue are already zero. The problem is not the red channel however (which ends up as 255 and hence is not affected), so any changes to that will only serve to desaturate the colour even more instead of darkening it.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> To make this a bit more mathmatical, the function that is applied by the transparency of the selection is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>f(x) = 0.4x + 153</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you apply this to all the channels of your colour you will see that this is indeed the case.

I still need the click event for keyboard devices, but of course, don't want the click event firing if I'm using a touch device.</p>  <p>A bonus question: Is there anyway to do this and additionally accommodate browsers that don't even have a touchstart event? In researching this, it looks like BlackBerry OS5 doesn't support touchstart so will also need to rely on click events for that browser. </p>  <p>ADDENDUM:</p>  <p>Perhaps a more comprehensive question is:</p>  <p>With jQuery, is it possible/recommended to handle both touch interactions and mouse interactions with the same bindings?</p>  <p>Ideally, the answer is yes. If not, I do have some options:</p>  <p>1) We use WURFL to get device info so could create our own matrix of devices. Depending on the device, we'll use touchstart OR click. </p>  <p>2) Detect for touch support in the browser via JS (I need to do some more research on that, but it seems like that is doable).</p>  <p>However, that still leaves one issue: what about devices that support BOTH. Some of the phones we support (namely the Nokias and BlackBerries) have both touch screens <em>and</em> keyboards.

I would not worry too much about the fact that you only need this for testing. Extracting this interface makes your code decoupled from database.

They will normally only appear once, but could be in either 'direction'. As such, to get the total relationships for a given type, I use a UNION similar to:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT ip.id, ip.name, SUM(totalUnion.EventTotals) as Events  FROM iplace ip   LEFT JOIN  (  SELECT object_id, count(*) as EventTotals FROM `iassociation` ia WHERE object_type_id=2 AND associated_object_type_id=14 GROUP BY object_id UNION ALL  SELECT associated_object_id, count(*) as EventTotals FROM `iassociation` ia WHERE associated_object_type_id=2 AND object_type_id=14 GROUP BY associated_object_id   ) totalUnion ON ip.id = totalUnion.object_id   WHERE ip.type_id IN (4,7,11,15,16)  GROUP BY ip.id </code></pre>  <p>That works ok..

For my research i am using Windows Server 2008 R2 with IIS 6.1 and SQL Server 2008 R2 in Virtualbox 4.1. I chose to use a virtual server because it was not an option to test on the live server. For profiling i am using ANTS Memory Profiler 7.0. In the beginning i was wondering why even the most simple websites already use up to ~30 - 40mb.<br> <br/> As an example i am using the 'My MVC Application' website, which is the tutorial website in Visual Studio, but the same concept applies to all websites i profiled. When i run ants profiler in the website in idle state, i get the following summary:  </p>  <p><code> Generation 1: 26kb<br> Generation 2: 2100kb<br> Large object heap: 240kb<br> Unused memory allocated to .NET: 3265kb<br> Unmanaged: 20890kb </code><br> Now, i am wondering what information is in the unmanaged block? Is there any way for me to find out and maybe lower the size of this block?</p>  <p>Also, there are 7000 string objects, which make up ~600k in total in memory in idle mode. Where do all these strings come from?

I didnt find a good example - piece of code - for a specific scenario. Like clients/server conversation. In my application´s protocol they have to send/recieve messages. Like: Server want to send a file to a client Client can accpet or no, if he accepts, server will send bytes over the same connection/socket. The rest of my application all uses blocking methods, server has a method</p>  <p>Heres what I did:</p>  <p>Server method:</p>  <pre><code>public synchronized void sendFile(File file) {   //send messsage asking if I can send a file   //block on read, waiting for client responde   //if client answers yes, start sending the bytes   //else return } </code></pre>  <p>Client methods:</p>  <pre><code>public void reciveCommand() {    //read/listen for a command from socket    //if is a send file command handleSendFileCommand();    //after the return of handleSendFileCommand() listen for another command }  public void handleSendFileCommand() {    //get the file server want to send    //check if it already has the file    //if it already has, then send a command to the socket saying it already has and return             //else send a command saying server can send the file    //create a FileInputStream, recive bytes and then return method } </code></pre>  <p>I am 100% sure this is wrong because, there is no way server and clients would talk bidirecional, I mean, when server wants to send a command to a server, they have to follow an order of commands until that conversation is finished, only then, they can send/recive another sequence of commands. Thats why I made all methods that send requests synchronized</p>  <p>It didnt took me a lot of time to realize I need to study about design patterns for that kind of application...

It's not an object, and so is not nullable : it has to have a value. These are the same rules as for Java - the primitive types are <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>char</code>... . On object creation, a primitive property is initialized to 0, 0.0, false, etc.</p>  <p>If you need to represent 'no data', then it's probably best to edit the class definition so that the bean property uses the corresponding object wrapper type - in this case<code>Integer</code> - which can then be set to <code>null</code>. </p>  <p>If you're unable to edit the class, then common work arounds are to use some kind of marker value - e.g. <code>-1</code>, or <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, or somesuch.

By invoking <code>setTimeout</code> its not calling itself anymore. The only closure created here is the anonymous function for <code>setTimeout</code>, once that is executed the garbage collector will recognize that the reference to the previous instance can get cleaned up. This probably will not happen instantly, but you definetly can't create a <code>stack overflow</code> using that. Lets view this example:</p>  <pre><code>function myFunc() {    var bigarray = new Array(10000).join('foobar');     setTimeout(myFunc, 200); } myFunc(); </code></pre>  <p>Watching the memory usage from your browser now. It'll grow constantly, but after a while (20-40 seconds for me) it'll get completely cleaned again. On the other hand, if we create a <em>real</em> recursion like this:</p>  <pre><code>function myFunc() {    var bigarray = new Array(10000).join('foobar');     myFunc(); } myFunc(); </code></pre>  <p>Our memory usage will grow, browsers locks down and we finally create that <code>stack overflow</code>.

That behavior is only true if no function-context is invoked (using a anonymous function for instance). If we re-write that like</p>  <pre><code>function myFunc() {    var bigarray = new Array(10000).join('foobar');     setTimeout(function() {      myFunc();    }, 200); } myFunc(); </code></pre>  <p>Browser memory seems not to get released any more.

Several Front End users have NTFS read access to the file. The Front End database (accdb) contains queries and a link to the Back End database file. Each Front End user has a local copy of the Front End database.</p>  <p>Here is the issue; if the Back End database needs to be updated, and Front End users have the Front End database open – The Back End database is Read Only. If I have all Front End users close their local copy of the database, the Back End database can then be updated. However, if the Back End file is opened, (Being Updated) and Front End users open their local copy of the database – They cannot run queries. </p>  <p>What I am trying to accomplish is Front End users can open their local copy of the database and run queries at anytime, and the Back End database can be opened and updated at anytime. Is there a way to do this? It is very frustrating when the Back End database is being updated, that users cannot run queries - And if Front End users are running queries, the Back End database can only be opened with read only access.</p>  <p>Thanks, Tom </p> </td><td><ms-access></td><td>1.0</td><td>java</td></tr><tr><td>\"<pre><code>        NSDateFormatter *formatter1=[[NSDateFormatter alloc]init];         [formatter1 setDateFormat:@\"\"HHmmss MMddyyyy\"\"];         NSDate *finalDate =[formatter1 dateFromString:@\"\"235959 12319999\"\"];         [formatter1 release]; </code></pre>  <p>For getting in NSString</p>  <pre><code>NSString *finalDateString =[formatter1 stringFromDate:finalDate]; </code></pre> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>6.0</td><td>iphone</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>To me it looks like <code>cycle_slideshow_image</code> calls itself three times each time it is called... change it to this:</p>  <pre><code>function cycle_slideshow_image(){    //This code cycles the slideshow caption headings and body text   $('h1.slideshowCaptionHeading:last').fadeOut(1500, function(){     $(this).prependTo('.captionHeaderArea');     $(this).show(1);    });   $('p.slideshowCaptionBody:last').fadeOut(1500, function(){     $(this).prependTo('.captionBodyArea');     $(this).show(1);    });   $('img.slideshowSlide:last').fadeOut(1500, function(){     $(this).prependTo($slideshowContainer);     $(this).show(1);     var delay = setTimeout(cycle_slideshow_image, 4000);   });  } </code></pre>  <p>Also, <code>cycle_top_bubble</code> is being called twice initially, so it's running in two loops. remove this line:</p>  <pre><code>var initialTestimonialDelay = setTimeout(cycle_top_bubble, 3000); </code></pre>  <p>Another thing to consider is that when your page becomes an inactive tab in the browser, the timeouts are clamped to 1000ms (<a href=\"\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">ref</a>) so the animation may build up if you have the timeouts too short</td><td>2</td><td>11.0</td><td>python</td></tr><tr><td><p>I have the following data in one table:</p>  <pre><code>Time, Type, Kilometers 12:00, 1, 0.1 12:30, 2, 0.2 14:00, 1, 0.4 15:00, 2, 1.0 16:00, 1, 1.2 16:30, 2, 1.5 16:45, 1, 2.0 </code></pre>  <p>This data is sorted chronologically using the DateTime field.

The signature of <code>stringstream::str()</code> is</p>  <pre><code>string stringstream::str() const; </code></pre>  <p>Which means that it returns a temporary <code>string</code> object.  Consequently, as soon as the line</p>  <pre><code>ss.str().c_str() </code></pre>  <p>finishes executing, the temporary <code>string</code> object is reclaimed.  This means that the outstanding pointer you received via <code>c_str()</code> is no longer valid, and any use of it leads to undefined behavior.</p>  <p>To fix this, if you really must return an <code>unsigned char*</code>, you'll need to manually copy the C-style string into its own buffer:</p>  <pre><code>/* Get a copy of the string that won't be automatically destroyed at the end of a statement. */ string value = ss.str();  /* Extract the C-style string. */ const char* cStr = value.c_str();  /* Allocate a buffer and copy the contents of cStr into it. */ unsigned char* result = new unsigned char[value.length() + 1]; copy(cStr, cStr + value.length() + 1, result);  /* Hand back the result. */ return result; </code></pre>  <p>Additionally, as @Als has pointed out, the stripping-off of <code>const</code> is a Bad Idea if you're planning on modifying the contents.  If you aren't modifying the contents, it should be fine, but then you ought to be returning a <code>const unsigned char*</code> instead of an <code>unsigned char*</code>.</p>  <p>Hope this helps!</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I was trying to do something using sizeof operator in c++.<br> Please refer to the following code snippet.<br> <a href=\"\"http://ideone.com//HgGYB\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">http://ideone.com//HgGYB</a>  </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main() {     int *pint = new int[5];     int temp = sizeof(*pint);     cout &lt;&lt; \"\"Size of the int array is \"\" &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; endl;     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I was expecting the output as 5*4 = 20.

This format can be used only for a single certificate, unlike a file with a privacy-enhanced mail format, which can contain multiple certificates.

For example, you can create and install a certificate and private key using key management utility, export the certificate and key to a PKCS12 file, then import the file into another keystore. This format is also useful for converting from one type of SSL implementation to a different implementation.

What happens to the thread at this point? Does control go back to the message loop and the UI thread is free to process other inputs?</p>  <p>When the awaited task completes, does the entire stack get pushed onto a message queue, such that control will return through each of those nested functions, or is something else entirely happening here?</p>  <p>And secondly (while I have your attention), I don't really understand why asynchronous methods need to be labeled with <code>async</code>. Can't any method be executed asynchronously? What if I want to execute a method asynchronously but it doesn't have an async keyword--is there a way to do that simply?</p>  <p>Cheers. :)</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Admittedly if I could get the sample code compiling I could probably just figure that out myself, but for one reason or another I'm running into a block there. What I really want to know is to what extent does a continuation continue... does it freeze the entire call stack, to resume it when the task completes, or does it only go back so far? Does a function itself need to be marked as async in order to support continuation, or (as I asked originally) does it continue the entire call stack?</p>  <p>If it <em>doesn't</em> freeze the entire call stack, what happens when the async await hits a non-async calling function? Does it block there? Wouldn't that defeat the point of await?

However, the first part works IF I delete the entire WordPress section. I need them BOTH to work simultaneously. WHAT is it about the WordPress piece that is causing the failure of the first section?

Product has <code>ID</code>, <code>Name</code>,<code>Description</code>, <code>Cost</code>, and other detailed columns.  Order has <code>ID</code> and <code>ProductID</code> columns (assume an order can only contain one product).</p>  <p>When displaying a list of orders in the system, I would like to also display the associated product name without all of the other data (i.e., eagerly load an order and its associated product name, and lazily load all of the other product properties):</p>  <pre><code>SELECT o.ID, o.ProductID, p.Name FROM Order o JOIN Product p ON o.ProductID=p.ID </code></pre>  <p>If I do this with NHibernate, I have two choices: eager loading or lazy loading.</p>  <p>With eager loading, I get something like:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT o.ID, o.ProductID, p.ID, p.Name, p.Description, p.Cost, p....

SELECT p.Name, p.Description, p.Cost, p.... FROM Product p WHERE p.ID=? </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>Here is a more concrete example of what I am trying to achieve.  I am working with an existing DAL and trying to integrate NHibernate.  One of the functions of the current DAL is that it allows retrieval of some basic foreign key information as part of the parent record.  Let's say there is a <code>User</code> table and a <code>Region</code> table.  Each user has a foreign key to the region in which they reside.  When displaying user information in a GUI, the region name should be displayed with the user, but other details about the region are not necessary.</p>  <p>In the current DAL, the <code>User</code> domain object has a member of type <code>ForeignKeyReference&lt;Region&gt;</code>.</p>  <pre><code>public class ForeignKeyReference&lt;T&gt; {     public virtual int ForeignKeyID { get; set; }     public virtual string ForeignNaturalKey { get; set; }     public virtual T Reference { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>When the <code>User</code> is retrieved from the database, the primary and natural keys for the <code>Region</code> are also retrieved, and the <code>Reference</code> is set to a proxy object.  I would like to simplify this with NHibernate, but still maintain this functionality.  For example, I would like to remove the <code>ForeignKeyReference&lt;Region&gt;</code> member and just have a <code>Region</code> member which is an NHibernate proxy.  On this proxy, I would like to be able to retrieve the ID and the Name without having to hit the database again.</p> </td><td><c#><nhibernate><lazy-loading><eager-loading></td><td>14.0</td><td>sql</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>You can get this via the static property <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.net.networkinformation.devicenetworkinformation.cellularmobileoperator%28v=VS.92%29.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">DeviceNetworkInformation.CellularMobileOperator</a>.</p>  <p>Remember that there may not always be one - in which case it returns null.</p>  <p>You can also get the <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.info.devicestatus_properties%28v=VS.92%29.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">device name and manufacturer</a> or the current country via the <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff431803%28v=vs.92%29.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Location services</a>.</p>  <p>The nearest you'de be able to get to a \"\"home country\"\" would be via the regional settings.</p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>4.0</td><td>php</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>can't test it right now, but try</p>  <pre><code>float: left; </code></pre>  <p>and/or</p>  <pre><code>border-width: 0; </code></pre>  <p>and/or</p>  <pre><code>padding: -3px; </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT - another try:</strong><br/></p>  <pre><code>-webkit-padding-start: 0px; -webkit-margin-start: 0px; text-indent: 0px; border-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; outline-offset: 0px; </code></pre>  <p>For a reference including compatibility information see <a href=\"\"http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariCSSRef/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001267-SW1\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariCSSRef/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001267-SW1</a></p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>3.0</td><td>jquery</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>You can use a MD5() comparison if you want a <strong>case sensitive</strong> select:</p>  <pre><code>$req=\"\"SELECT * FROM INSTITUTS WHERE MD5(inst_name)=MD5('$fc_inst')\"\"; </code></pre>  <p>of course you consume a little bit of the server's cpu but it's rather simpler than those boring collations.</p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>What is similar between interfaces and type classes is that they name and describe a set of related operations. The operations themselves are described via their names, inputs, and outputs. Likewise there may be many implementations of these operations that will likely differ in their implementation.</p>  <p>With that out of the way, here are some notable differences:</p>  <ul> <li>Interfaces methods are always associated with an object instance. In other words, there is always an implied 'this' parameter that is the object on which the method is called. All inputs to a type class function are explicit.</li> <li>An interface implementation must be defined as part of the class that implements the interface. Conversely, a type class 'instance' can be defined completely seperate from its associated type...even in another module.</li> <li>A type class allows you to define a 'default' implementation for any of the defined operations. Interfaces are strictly type specifications only, no implementation.</li> </ul>  <p>In general, I think its fair to say that type classes are more powerful and flexible than interfaces. How would you define an interface for converting a string to some value or instance of the implementing type? It's certainly not impossible, but the result would not be intuitive or elegant. Have you ever wished it was possible to implement an interface for a type in some compiled library?

The problem with strings is that they cannot be mutated. So any time you need to make a change, a new string is created and all the information will be copied to the new string. Stringbuilder works with an array, so when a character needs to change its real easy. But when data needs to be inserted the part behind the insertion needs to be moved and when the characters no longer fit in the array a whole new array needs to be created and the old data gets copied in.</p>  <p>That could be whats happeing, the array inside Stringbuilder keeps growing and old data needs to be copied in every time. For example, if there is space for 4 pages in the Stringbuilder, at some point the Stringbuilder needs to reserve space for (usally double) 8 pages, then needs to copy 4 pages of data.</p>  <p>This could be the reason for the excessive amount of time used.</p>  <p>If you use a stream instead, like Kratz said, the hardware will simply increase the allocated memory for your stream. Then there is no need to copy all the old data.</p>  <p>About the pointers: it would help if you know beforehand how much space you need, otherwise you would probably end up overwriting memory from another program. But if you know beforehand how much data you are going to use you can use it for the stringbuilder:</p>  <pre><code>new System.Text.StringBuilder(amountOfCharsNeeded); </code></pre>  <p>Edit: Using pointers like in C++ will effectively be the same as using StringBuilder in terms of memory usage and performance, only you will be managing the data yourself.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>My workplace use MATLAB and sub-products Simulink, Realtime workshop (RTW), RTW Embedded Coder.

To me it seems you have tightly coupled a Player to a ClientConnection, which might make it less testable. I also think that coupling a Player with his connection is probably violating the SRP, since they have very distinct responsibilities.</p>  <p>I've written a system which seems similar to what you wish to acheive, and I done so by linking a player to a connection only via delegates and interfaces. I have a separate World and Server class library, and a third project, Application, which references the two, and creates an instance of Server and World. My Player object is in the World, and a Connection in the Server - these two projects do not reference one another, so you can consider Player without any terms of networking.</p>  <p>The method I use is to make SocketHandler abstract, and implement a concrete handler in the Application project. The handler has a reference to the world object, which can be passed to it on creation. (I do so by means of factory classes -  eg, ClientConnectionFactory (in Application), where the Server knows only of abstract Connections and Factories.)</p>  <pre><code>public class ClientConnectionFactory : IConnectionFactory {     private readonly World world;      public ClientConnectionFactory(World world) {         this.world = world;     }      Connection IConnectionFactory.Create(Socket socket) {         return new ClientConnection(socket, world);     } } </code></pre>  <p>The ClientConnection can then forward the World reference to it's handler, along with any information the handler requires about the Connection itself, such as the Send methods in particular. Here I just pass the Connection object itself to the Handler.</p>  <pre><code>public ClientConnection(Socket socket, World world)     : base(socket) {     this.handler = new ClientHandler(this, world);     ... } </code></pre>  <p>Most of the coordination between the game logic and the networking is then contained inside the ClientHandler, and perhaps any other sister objects it references.</p>  <pre><code>class ClientHandler : SocketHandler {     private readonly Connection connection;     private readonly World world;      public ClientHandler(Connection connection, World world) {         this.connection = connection;         this.world = world;         ...     }      //overriden method from SocketHandler     public override void HandleMessage(Byte[] data) {         ...     } } </code></pre>  <p>The rest involves the ClientHandler creating it's Player object, assigning delegates or interfaces to update actions, and then adding the player to the pool of players in World. Initially I done this with a list of events in Player, which I subscribe to with methods in the ClientHandler (which knows of the Connection), but it turned out that there were dozens of events in the Player object which became a mess to maintain.</p>  <p>The option I went for was to use abstract notifiers in the World project on the player. For example, for movement I would have an IMovementNotifier object in Player. In Application, I would create a ClientNotifier which implements this interface and does the relevant sending of data to the client. The ClientHandler would create the ClientNotifier and pass it to it's Player object.</p>  <pre><code>class ClientNotifier : IMovementNotifier //, ..., + bunch of other notifiers {     private readonly Connection connection;      public ClientHandler(Connection connection) {         this.connection = connection;     }      void IMovementNotifier.Move(Player player, Location destination) {         ...         connection.Send(new MoveMessage(...));     } } </code></pre>  <p>The ClientHandler ctor can be changed to instantiate this notifier.</p>  <pre><code>public ClientHandler(Connection connection, World world) {     this.connection = connection;     this.world = world;     ...     var notifier = new ClientNotifier(this);     this.player = new Player(notifier);     this.world.Players.Add(player); } </code></pre>  <p>So the resulting system is one where ClientHandler is responsible for all incoming messages and events, and ClientNotifier handles all outgoing stuff. These two classes are quite difficult to test as they contain a lot of other crap. Networking can't really be unit tested anyway, but the Connection object in these two classes can be mocked. The World library is entirely unit testable without any consideration of networking components, which is what I wanted to acheive in my design anyway.</p>  <p>It's a big system, and I've not covered much of it here, but hope this can give you some hints. Ask me if you'd like any more specific information on it.</p>  <p>If I could give any more advice, it would be to avoid any static or singletons - they'll come back to bite you. Favour increasing complexity if you need to as an alternative, but document where you need to. The system I have might seem complex to a maintainer, but is well documented.

So long in fact that I can manually decompose the query into three selects and find the result I want faster.</p>  <p>When I try to EXPLAIN the queries, I observe that indeed they are very similar (a full join on the tables and only then a WHERE clause), so my question is: how can I achieve a fast select, that relies on the fact that the filter on authors should result in a much smaller join with the other two tables?</p>  <p>Note that I tried the same queries with MySQL and got results in line with what I expected (selecting first is much faster).</p>  <p>Thank you.</p> </td><td><mysql><sql><many-to-many><h2></td><td>9.0</td><td>objective-c</td></tr><tr><td><p>I've got a problem with an ambiguous grammar.

This suggests to me that actually, the vast, vast majority of your time is not spent in the hash table at all, but in the allocator. The reason that this is an unfair comparison is because your GC will never collect in such a trivial program, giving it an undue performance advantage, and native allocators do significant caching of free memory- but that'll never come into play in such a trivial example, because you've never allocated or deallocated anything and so there's nothing to cache.</p>  <p>Finally, the Boost pool implementation is thread-safe, whereas you never play with threads so the GC can just fall back to a single-threaded implementation, which will be much faster.</p>  <p>I resorted to a hand-rolled, non-freeing non-thread-safe pool allocator and got down to 0.525ms for C++ to 0.45ms for C# (on my machine).

All forms and gui controls you are using should implement some kind of interface (e.g. <code>ISkin</code>). Also your application should have some kind of <code>SkinSelector</code>. This one holds all informations about coloring, fonts, etc and it also gets a reference to the MainForm. Within the constructor it recursively runs through the Controls property of the form and checks if there are any controls implementing your interface (simply using <code>as ISkin</code> and check for <code>null</code>). If it is skinnable, simply set the colors, fonts, etc. of the control as defined within you <code>SkinSelector</code>. Sounds quite easy but the problem is, that you have to derive all gui controls and add your interface to them. So this is not such a complicated thing, but maybe a lot of work. Maybe you can test if Generics can help you out by using a <code>SkinWrapper&lt;T&gt; where T : Control</code> and an extension function like <code>ISkin ToSkinnableControl(this Control control)</code>). But this will only work if you need to change a few common properties, that are the same for all controls. If you need more skin control e.g. for the DataGridView or a ComboBox i think derivement is the only way to help you out.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>These can help you.</p>  <p><a href=\"\"http://displaytag.sourceforge.net/1.2/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Display tag library 1.2</a></p>  <p><a href=\"\"http://www.javaworkspace.com/displayTags.do\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Pagination Using Display Tags</a> </p>  <p><a href=\"\"http://demo.displaytag.org/displaytag-examples-1.1/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Display Tag Examples</a></p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>11.0</td><td>python</td></tr><tr><td><p>I fear that combination of DDD and PropertyChanged/CollactionChanged events might now be the best idea. The problem is, that if you base your logic around these events it is extremely hard to manage the complexity as one PropertyChanged leads to another and another and soon enough you loose control. </p>  <p>Another reason why ProportyChanged events and DDD doesn't exactly fit is that in DDD every business operation should be as explicit as possible. Keep in mind that DDD is supposed to bring technical stuff into the world of business, not the other way around. And basing on the PropertyChanged/CollectionChanged doesn't seem very explicit.</p>  <p>In DDD the main goal is to keep consistency inside aggregate, in other words, you need to model the aggregate in such way, that whatever operation you invoke the aggregate is valid and consistent (if the operation succeeds of course). </p>  <p>If you build your model right that there's no need to worry about 'building' transaction - an operation on aggregate should be a transaction itself.</p>  <p>I don't know how your model looks like, but you might consider moving the responsibilities one level 'up' in the aggregate tree, quite possibly adding additional logical entities in the process, instead of relying on the PropertyChanged events.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>Lets assume you have a collection of payments with statuses and whenever a payment changes, you want to recalculate the total balance of customer orders. Instead of subscribing changes to the payments collection and calling a method on customer when collection changes, you might do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>    public class CustomerOrder     {         public List&lt;Payment&gt; Payments { get; }         public Balance BalanceForOrder { get; }          public void SetPaymentAsReceived(Guid paymentId)         {             Payments.First(p =&gt; p.PaymentId == paymentId).Status = PaymentStatus.Received;             RecalculateBalance();         }     } </code></pre>  <p>You might have noticed, that we recalculate the balance of single order and not the balance of entire customer - and in most cases that's ok as customer belongs to another aggregate and its balance can be simply queried when needed. That is exactly the part that shows this 'consistency only within aggregate' thingy - we don't care about any other aggregate at this point, we only deal with single order. If that's not ok for requirements, then the domain is modeled incorrectly.</p>  <p>My point is, that in DDD there's no single good model for every scenario - you have to understand how the business works to be successful. </p>  <p>If you take a look at the example above, you'll see that there is no need to 'build' the transaction - entire transaction is located in <code>SetPaymentAsReceived</code> method. In most cases, one user action should lead to one particular method on an entity withing aggregate - this method explicitly relates to business operation (of course this method may call other methods).</p>  <p>As for events in DDD, there is a concept of Domain Events, however these are not directly related with PropertyChanged/CollectionChanged technical events. Domain Events indicate the business operations (transactions) that have been completed by an aggregate. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Overal it seems that pushing all logic in the domain model makes the   domain model rather complex</p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course it does as it is supposed to be used for scenarios with complex business logic.

Whilst you can register cp65001 as an encoding manually:</p>  <pre><code>def cp65001(name):     if name.lower()=='cp65001':         return codecs.lookup('utf-8')  codecs.register(cp65001) </code></pre>  <p>and this allows you to <code>print u'some unicode string'</code>, it doesn't allow you to write non-ASCII characters in that Unicode string. You get the same odd errors (IOError 0 et al) that you do when you try to write non-ASCII UTF-8 sequences directly as byte strings.</p>  <p>Unfortunately UTF-8 is a second-class citizen under Windows. NT's Unicode model was drawn up before UTF-8 existed and consequently you're expected to use two-byte-per-code-unit encodings (UTF-16, originally UCS-2) anywhere you want consistent Unicode. Using byte strings, like many portable apps and languages (such as Python) written with C's <code>stdio</code>, doesn't fit that model.</p>  <p>And rewriting Python to use the Windows Unicode console calls (like WriteConsoleW) instead of the portable C stdio ones doesn't play well with shell tricks like piping and redirecting to a file. (Not to mention that you still have to change from the default terminal font to a TTF one before you can see the results working at all...)</p>  <p>Ultimately if you need a command line with working UTF-8 support for stdio-based apps, you'd probably be better off using an alternative to the Windows Console that deliberately supports it, such as Cygwin's, or Python's IDLE or pywin32's PythonWin.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>69.0</td><td>linux</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p><img src=\"\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ggFZ.png\"\" alt=\"\"enter image description here\"\">hie all</td><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>If you want to keep using the <code>iframe</code> method of embedding Youtube vids, you can simply set the WMODE via query variable <code>?wmode=transparent</code>.

An event always has additional data associated with it, for example whether it comes from a trusted source (user's keyboard rather than JavaScript code). Some attacks (mostly against MSIE because it had mutable event objects) were using this - they caught a trusted event, changed it and dispatched it again elsewhere (changing might not always be required, dispatching it at a different element is enough for some attacks). In the end disallowing redispatching of events turned out to be the best solution. After all, this functionality isn't really required: creating a new event object with identical properties (minus hidden data) isn't exactly hard.</p>  <p>Pretty much all the security issues in this area were related to the file input control.

I can fix the problem by simple adding an extra byte to the struct but that seems like a band-aid fix.</p>  <p>I put the packed attribute on the structure because I wanted to make sure the compiler didn't insert any filler bytes in between my variables. If that were to happen, the values in my structure would be incorrect when copied over from the received character array.</p>  <p>I know there is also an attribute called aligned. Does aligned just align the start of the structure to an even byte or does it align every item in the structure to an even byte? Do you think the aligned attribute is required here? If I add the aligned attribute to this structure, I should also add it to the structure on the device that is sending the data, right? As of now they are both defined the exact same way as shown above.</p>  <p>If I add the aligned attribute should I remove the packed attribute?

What you really seem to be after is if there's a way to partially specialize member functions, like the constructor.

You always have to specialize the entire class. The reason is simple: You have to know the full type of the class first <em>before</em> you even know which member functions exist. Consider the following simple situation:</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename  T&gt; class Bar {   void somefunction(const T&amp;); };  template &lt;&gt; class Bar&lt;int&gt; {   double baz(char, int); }; </code></pre>  <p>Now <code>Bar&lt;T&gt;::somefunction()</code> depends on <code>T</code>, but the function only <em>exists</em> when <code>T</code> is not <code>int</code>, because <code>Bar&lt;int&gt;</code> is an entirely different class.</p>  <p>Or consider even another specialization <code>template &lt;&gt; class Bar&lt;double&gt; : public Zip {};</code> -- even the polymorphic nature of a class can be entirely different in a specialization!</p>  <p>So the only way you can provide <s>specializations</s> new declarations of members, including constructors, is by specializing the entire class.

Something like this untested code:</p>  <pre><code>cont.var.vec &lt;- # names of all your continuous variables breaks &lt;- function(var,n) quantiles( dfrm[[var]],                                       probs=seq(0,1,length.out=n),                                       na.rm=TRUE) lapply(dfrm[ dfrm$IV == 1 , cont.var.vec] , breaks, n=5) </code></pre> </td><td>NULL</td><td>2.0</td><td>javascript</td></tr><tr><td><p>This might be a dumb question but if I leave <code>$to = ''</code> in <code>mail($to,...)</code> and put <code>$to</code> to mail headers <code>'to' =&gt; '&lt;some@mail.address&gt;'</code>, might this cause this effect(two 'to' headers)?: </p>  <pre><code>To: Subject: 123 From: &lt;&gt; To: &lt;some@mail.address&gt; </code></pre> </td><td><php><email></td><td>1.0</td><td>java</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I have <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221403%28VS.95%29.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">referred to MSDN</a> and found out that it is quite easy to cancel a BackgroundWorker's _DoWork()</td><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I have a python script that performs URL requests using the urllib2.

<code>&lt;Object, Object&gt;</code> to a <code>Task&lt;?, ?&gt;</code> because who knows what the wildcards are?  It could be a <code>Task&lt;String, Integer&gt;</code> in which case the adapter's bounds wouldn't match and so it wouldn't be applicable.</p>  <p>(Well, it might be that in this case they are OK because they're consumers, but the compiler can't infer that by itself.  If this <em>is</em> the case, then <code>Task.addTaskListener</code> needs to be declared to take a <code>TaskListener&lt;? super T, ? super V&gt;</code> in order to satisfy the compiler.)</p>  <p>Because of the way the <code>addTaskListener</code> is declared, you need to pass in a listener with the exact same generic bounds.  And this is impossible when you declare them as wildcards, since you have no way to refer back to them later.  What you need to do instead is make the method generic, which is similar to using <code>?</code> wildcards except you're giving them names so you can refer to them later on in the method:</p>  <pre><code>public &lt;T, V&gt; void executeTask(Task&lt;T, V&gt; task, boolean handleException) {     task.addTaskListener(new TaskListener.Adapter&lt;T, V&gt;() {         @Override         public void failed(TaskEvent event) { /* ... */ }     });     getContext().getTaskService().execute(task); } </code></pre>  <p>As for the second part, I have no idea - it looks fine to me as well.  Perhaps this is some misleading error that comes from the raw types, although that seems unlikely since neither generic parameter is involved in the declaration at all.  If the compiler still doesn't like the override after the above changes, then perhaps the problem is somewhere else (like you've accidentally placed the method in the wrong class' scope, etc.)</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>5.0</td><td>android</td></tr><tr><td><p>We have many projects that need to use common version numbers.<br> What is best practice for doing this with Ant/Ivy?

Basically, you want to approach each division in sequence: maintain a set of the best available solutions for the divisions already considered, then add the remaining divisions one by one.</p>  <p>Specifically:  you can combine two option matrices (as described for each division) into a combined option matrix.  The rows and columns for this matrix are all possible sums of the rows and columns of the original matrices, and the payoff entries are the sum of the payoffs in the original matrices.  Note that it is possible for rows and columns to overlap (if two sums end up being the same); in that case you clearly want to use the largest payoff.  Also, you will need to store how each payoff was achieved, so you can eventually report how to achieve the optimum solution.</p>  <p>Note that, if the sizes of the original matrices are A and B, the size of resulting matrix could be O(A*B) in the worst case.  However, you don't need to store any rows or columns that are larger than the total available resources.  Also, as previously noted, rows and columns will be combined if there is more than one way to reach that sum.  Finally, I believe you can drop any matrix entries whose payoffs are no better than other matrix entries that require less resources; the resulting sparse matrices may take much less space and computation to deal with.</p>  <p>In any case, once you've combined all your divisions into one final matrix, report the largest payoff entry as your solution.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>14.0</td><td>sql</td></tr><tr><td><p>I need to encrypt the password the user enters in a text box on the UI, save it, and then decrypt it when the getPassword() method is called.</p>  <p>What is the correct JDK 1.4 API I should use?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </td><td><encryption><passwords><java></td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>Python honors <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environmental variable.

I cannot seem to recreate it as getting the reference to the class also returns that MyEntity never had a BaseClass.  However, if I type in <code>var newEnt = MyEntity();</code> instead of getting the class name through <code>getDefinitionByName</code> it works normally and extends from BaseClass.</p>  <p>I need it to extend from BaseClass as that is the main class all entities in my game engine require to use.</p>  <p>Any ideas?

It is different from the mutual exclusion model that is used by a synchronized block.</p>  <p>The wait-notify or mutual cooperation model is typically used in a producer-consumer scenario where one thread produces events that are consumed by another thread. Well-written implementations will strive to avoid the scenarios where a consumer is starved or the producer overruns the consumer with too many events. To avoid this, you would use the wait-notify protocol where</p>  <ul> <li>the consumer <code>wait</code>s for the producer to produce an event.</li> <li>the producer produces the event and <code>notifies</code> the consumer, and then usually goes to sleep, until it is <code>notified</code> by the consumer.</li> <li>when the consumer is notified of an event, it wakes up, processes the event and the <code>notifies</code> the producer that it has finished processing the event.</li> </ul>  <p>You could have many producers and consumers in this scenario. Acquiring the monitor through the mutual exclusion model, on <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code> is bound to destroy this model, since the producer and the consumer do not perform the waiting explicitly. The underlying threads will be present in either the wait set (used by the wait-notify model) or the entry set (used by the mutual exclusion model) of a monitor. Invoking <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code> signals thread(s) to be moved from the wait set to the entry set of the monitor (where there may be contention for the monitor, among several threads, and not just the recently notified one).</p>  <p>Now, when you want to automatically acquire the monitor on <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code> and <code>notifyAll</code> using the mutual exclusion model, it is usually an indication that you do not need to be using the wait-notify model. This is by inference - you would typically signal other threads, only after doing some work in one thread, i.e. on a change in state. If you are automatically acquiring the monitor and invoking <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code>, you are merely moving threads from the wait set to the entry set, without any intermediate state in your program, implying that the transition is unnecessary.

Right now, Spring is still the de facto standard.</p>  <p>Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.   Fool me three times, EJB.</p>  <p>Some will claim that Spring is proprietary.  I would argue that the vendor implementations of the JavaEE specs have been just as proprietary, if not more so.</p>  <p>I went through a major conversion recently of moving a bunch of Java Applications from JBoss to Weblogic.  All of the Spring/Hibernate apps ported with zero modifications, because they had all the libraries they needed built in.  All the apps that used JPA and EJB and JSF were a disaster to port.  Subtle differences in interpretations of JPA, EJB, and JSF between appservers caused all kinds of nasty bugs that took forever to fix.  Even something as simple as JNDI naming was completely different between AppServers.</p>  <p>Spring is an implementation.  JavaEE is a spec.  That is a HUGE difference.  I would prefer to use a spec IF the spec was 100% air-tight and gave absolutely no wiggle room in the way vendors implement that spec.  But the JavaEE spec has never been that.  Maybe JavaEE6 is more air-tight?  I don't know.  The more you can package in your WAR, and the less you depend on AppServer libraries, the more portable your application will be, and that, after all, is the reason I use Java and not Dot-NET.</p>  <p>Even IF the spec was air-tight, it would be nice to be able to upgrade the appserver without having to upgrade all my technology stacks in all my applications along with it.  If I want to upgrade from JBoss 4.2 to JBoss 7.0, I have to consider the impact of the newer version of JSF on all of my applications.  I don't have to consider the impact on my Spring-MVC (or Struts) applications.   </p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>1.0</td><td>java</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I found another type of encoding that might be better than GZIP for XML over HTTP, it's called <a href=\"\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xml\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">EXI</a> (Efficient XML Interchange).

The effect of a cv-qualifier-seq in a function declarator   is not the same as adding cv-qualification on top of the function   type, i.e., it does not create a cv-qualified function type.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I read correctly, you <em>can</em> return a pointer to non const member in a const member function. You just won't be able to call it with a non const object.</p>  <p>A way to forbid the calling is:</p>  <pre><code>private:     struct private_      {         void this_type_does_not_support_comparisons() {}     };  public:     typedef void (private_::*bool_type)() const;      operator bool_type() const     {         return ok_ ? &amp;private_::this_type_does_not_support_comparisons : 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>Pointer to member functions can still be compared for equality. You have to write an <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code> for <code>Testable::bool_type</code> types which trigger an error. Easier to do with the CRTP form of the safe bool idiom since those operators become templates and thus can have an erroneous body.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; class safe_bool_concept {     // Implementation detail of safe bool protected:     ~safe_bool_concept() {}  public:     operator safe_bool() const     {         return static_cast&lt;const T*&gt;(this)-&gt;is_null() ? ...;     } };  struct Foo : safe_bool_concept&lt;Foo&gt; {     ...  private:     friend class safe_bool_concept&lt;Foo&gt;;     bool is_null() const { ... } }; </code></pre>  <p>then you can do (do the same with <code>!=</code>):</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; void operator==(const safe_bool_concept&lt;T&gt;&amp; x, const safe_bool_concept&lt;T&gt;&amp;) {     x.some_private_member(); // invalid, but won't be generated                              // unless safe_bool classes are compared } </code></pre>  <p>This means that the safe bool idiom should be implemented via CRTP if you want to forbid comparisons. Comparisons to zero will still work however.</p>  <p>If you go the non-member function route, you'll have to provide <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> too.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td><p>I'm creating a similar tag editor like SO and it's working pretty well i must say.

Given that I'm currently working on a rebuild/redesign of a very valuable site from scratch, the use of AJAX was something we considered carefully.  While I favour the use of AJAX where possible there are 2 situations in particular where I won't use it or at least, will make sure there's a rock solid fallback.</p>  <p>The first is, unfortunately, Amir's example.  Pages should be loaded with an actual request to the page that serves the full page.  The only place I sometimes don't do this is an admin interface where there are no concerns about SEO.  While Amir does suggest have a fallback where the page wouldn't load via AJAX, this is a case where you're really just increasing the complexity of your site and user experience (either your back button won't be functional or you'll have to also use a library that deals with browser history to keep back/forward function in the AJAX version).</p>  <p>The second situation where I will attempt to always make sure there is a fallback is any kind of form.  Be it for a comment, a calculator or some revenue generating aspect, forms are an important way a user interacts with you site.  Ideally, where possible and appropriate, forms <strong>should</strong> (personal opinion) be done with AJAX.  It generally improves the user experience as you can add nice loading gifs etc...  Good user feedback is a major plus and is much better than a non AJAX version where they just see the browser churning until the page comes up.</p>  <p>That being said, as forms are a major interaction point, you can't afford them breaking so they should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> work without AJAX.  It's not even a matter of the 5% of users (some of which I expect is actually devs testing their sites on production environments :-P ) with javascript disabled.  What if your javascript has an error?  Or maybe you've used a function that doesn't exist in all browsers so again, your javascript errors in some browsers?  In those situations you want your forms to still work so it is vital to make sure they fallback to non AJAX versions.</p>  <p>My advice would be to always build your site to work without AJAX 100% then look for places you feel can be improved by the use of AJAX and add it as a layer on top.

Is there an editor smart enough to adjust depending on where I'm editing within a file?</p>  <p>Failing that, I'm looking for an editor that has really great code hinting and completion, even for libraries like jQuery, and it should be flawless at auto indenting, etc.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>EDIT: Free solutions only.</p> </td><td><ide><editor></td><td>95.0</td><td>pdf</td></tr><tr><td><p>OK, from what I know actionscript in Flex runs asynchronously. I need the ability to run a method in a loop synchronously.

One of them might need to Interrupt() the other, but only if the other thread is in th middle of processing data that is related to the object that is affected by the first thread. How can I only Interrupt() the second thread based on certain conditions.</p>  <p>I have been working on a program that spins up two threads for processing socket data and updating the GUI with the information. The two threads (topologyThread and dataThread) handle two different aspects of my application, namely topology change notifications for our wireless sensor network, and data information for receiving and processing data from the wireless sensor network.</p>  <p>When data is coming into the dataThread, it's possible that the network member that the data packet represents has already been removed by the topologyThread and as such should not be processed. So, I was thinking that using the Thread.Interrupt() method would allow me to instantly notify the dataThread of changes to the topology and prevent some of the problems we have seen with trying to update the GUI with data for a network member that is no longer connected. My question is this: How can I tell if the dataThread needs to be interrupted? I don't want it to throw an exception while it's processing data for a network member that is still connected, but I want it to be interrupted if it's in the middle of processing data for a network member that is then disconnected. </p>  <p>Scenario 1:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>dataThread processes data to the end and updates GUI</li> </ul>  <p>Scenario 2:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>Network member has been disconnected so no processing takes place.</li> </ul>  <p>Scenario 3:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>dataThread begins processing data</li> <li>topologyThread receives notice that the network member is disconnected and removes it from topology.</li> <li>dataThread tries to update GUI for a network member that is no longer connected.</li> </ul>  <p>It's scenario 3 that I am trying to code for. In our testing, this scenario is where the tree view in the sidebar freezes up and the app has to be killed. But I only need to interrupt the dataThread if the object that is affected by the topologyThread is the one that the dataThread is currently acting on.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading. :)</p> </td><td><c#><multithreading></td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>I finally figured out how to do this.</p>  <p>I just wanted to mention beforehand that I did try to start with a fresh Eclipse install, export the preferences to a <code>.epf</code> file, change just one single setting, export again, and compare the files.

It is a major evolutionary leap forward and will save you a lot of trouble. However, you will still run into the same problem trying to do what you want to do. Spring has to be able to instantiate the form command object, like it says in the exception you're getting. It cannot instantiate an interface, like it says. You'll have to try a different approach, which will likely involve more work on your part and less help from Spring MVC. You can just work with request parameter values directly and not use a command object. You will have to manually bind the parameters to your correct subclass instance. Or instead you could perhaps try to use a non-abstract base class for your subclasses. That way you could specify that class as the command object and Spring could instantiate it and bind values to it. You could do something similar by having a separate class that models your forms and is not in your existing class hierarchy. You'll have to translate that into your classes, though. You may also want to examine your object model and make sure you're really modeling things correctly. Generally if you are doing something funky that the standard tools don't support you are probably wandering off into bad territoy.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>67.0</td><td>firefox</td></tr><tr><td><p>I have a need to convert audio samples from 11025 and 22050 to 44100; I'm looking for the fastest and best sounding conversion routine.

Here is my experience.</p>  <h2>iPhone Android dual targetting</h2>  <p>Even though the API guides claim that the functionality is available for both the Android and iPhone, this is not the case. Much of the stuff simply don't work on one of the platforms. Some things works differently. </p>  <p>A lot of the people in the class has done iPhone applications, and they can not make them work on Android without major rewrites. I developed a simple childrens app called Animap (see android market / Appstore in Sweden) and started developing under Windows. Once the Android target was working I opened the project on OS X. It does not show any build stuff for iPhone, just for Android. You need to start a dual target project under OS X. (Ok, I copied the relevant files to a new project). Next problem - the animations does not work on iPhone (they work on Android). The scrolling events does not work the same on the iPhone. (i.e on Android you get the untouch event when user stops scrolling and releases their finger from the screen, this does not happen on the iPhone). </p>  <p>Since this is not mentioned somewhere you basicly need to do trial and error programming on first one platform, then on the other platform. By trial and error I mean it will take about two days to get such a simple App as Animap working on the other platform. You will also need to have if (android) then... or if(iphone)... all over your code... </p>  <h2>Download and setup</h2>  <p>You must follow the instructions to the letter.  Do not try to use java 64 bit. It will not compile the KitchenSink 1.4.0 demo application. (1.3 works OK!) You must put files directly on the C drive as long pathnames will make the external program not receiving all command line parameters if they get to long. (Fine for small programs though) 1/3 of the times, the toolchain simply stops and you must press 'launch' again. Then it will probably work... very unreliable.  The simulator will not be found on startup and then you must simply kill of adb.exe with Ctrl+Alt+Delete and retry.</p>  <h2>Network connection</h2>  <p>On a wifi-network you sometimes looses the live connection and Titanium crashes on you (the compile/deploy interface)  If you do not have a working internet connection it will not start as it can not log you in to their servers. </p>  <h2>API</h2>  <p>CSS, HTML and jQuery is a breeze compared to this. Titanium resembles any other old GUI API, and you need to set some properties for every single button/field/etc. Getting a field wrong is just to easy, remembering all the properties that needs to be set? Did you spell it with capital letters at the right place? (as this is not caught by the compiler, but will be seen as a runtime error if you are lucky to test that part)</p>  <p>In Titanium things simply break when you add another view on top of a control or click somewhere else in the GUI. </p>  <h2>Documentation</h2>  <p>Several API pages carry the Android symbol, but will only return a null when you try to create the control. They are not simply available on the Android platform despite the symbols. Sometimes Android is mention to not support a particular method, but then the whole API is missing. </p>  <h2>KitchenSink</h2>  <p>The demo application. Did I mention it does not compile if you put it in your Eclipse project folder because the path gets too long? Must be put on your C drive in the root folder. I currently use a symbolik link (mklink /J ...)</p>  <h2>Undocumented methods</h2>  <p>You must propably use things as label.setText('Hello World') to change a label reliable but this is not documented at all. </p>  <h2>Debugging</h2>  <p>Titanium.API.info('Printouts are the only way to debug');</p>  <h2>Editing</h2>  <p>The APIs are not available in any good format so you can not get ordinary code-completion with help etc. in Eclipse. Aptana please help out!</p>  <h2>Hardware</h2>  <p>It seems that the compiler/tools are not multithreaded so a fast computer with a fast harddrive is a must, as you must do a lot of trial &amp; error. Did I mention the poor documentation? You must try out everything there as you can't trust it!</p>  <h2>Some positive things</h2>  <ul> <li>Open Source</li> <li><p>From previous projects I have promised myself never ever to use closed source again as you can't simply fix things just by throwing hours and manpower at it. Important when you are late in the project and need to deliver for a hard deadline. This is open source and I have been able to see why the tool chain breaks and actually fix it as well. </p></li> <li><p>Bugdatabase</p></li> <li><p>It's also open. You can simply see that your not alone and do a workaround instead of another 4 hours spent on trial&amp;error. </p></li> <li><p>Community</p></li> <li>Seems to be active on their forums. </li> </ul>  <h2>Bugs</h2>  <ul> <li><em>Titanium 1.4 is not threadsafe</em>. That means if you make use of threads (use the url: property in a createWindow call) and program like the threads are working and send events with data back and forth you run into a lot of very, very strange stuff - lost handlers, lost windows, too many events, too few events, etc. etc. This is all dependent on the timing, putting the rows of code in different order might crash or heal your application. Adding a window in another file.js breaks your app.js execution... This also trashes internal datastructures in Titanium, as they sometimes can update internal datastructures in paralell, overwriting a just changed value with something else.</li> </ul>  <p>Much of the problems I have had with Titanium comes from my background on realtime systems like OSE who support hundreds of threads, events and message passing. This is supposed to work in Titanium 1.4 but it simply doesn't do it reliably. </p>  <ul> <li><p>Javascript (which is new to me) dies silently on runtime errors. This also means that small and common bugs, like misspelling a variable name or reading in a null-pointer does not crash when it should so you can debug it. Instead parts of your program just stop working, for instance an eventhandler, because you misplaced/misstyped a character. </p></li> <li><p>Then we have more simple bugs in Titanium, like some parameters not working in the functions (which is quite common on the Android platform at least). </p></li> <li><p>Trial and Error debug cycle speed Having run Titnium Developer on several computers, I noticed that the bottleneck is the harddrive. An SSD drive on a laptop makes the build cycle about 3-5 times faster than on a 4200 rpm drive. On a desktop, having dual drives in RAID 1 (striping mode) makes the build about 25 percent faster than on a single drive with a somewhat faster CPU and it also beats the SSD drive laptop. </p></li> </ul>  <h2>Summary</h2>  <ul> <li>From the comments in this thread there seems to be a fight for the number of platforms a tool like this can deliver app's for. The number of API seems to be the key selling-point. </li> </ul>  <p>This shines through very much when you start using it. If you look at the open bugtracker you see that the number of bugs keeps increasing faster than the number of fixed bugs. This is usually a sign that the developers keep adding more functionality, rather than concentrating on getting the number of bugs down. </p>  <p>As a consultant trying to deliver rather simple apps to multiplatforms for a customer - I'm not sure this is actually faster than doing native app development on two platforms. This is due to the fact that when you are up to speed you are fast with Titanium, but then suddenly you look down and find yourself in a hole so deep you don't know how many hours must be spent for a workaround. You can simply NOT promise a certain functionality for a certain deadline/time/cost. </p>  <p>About myself: Been using Python for two years with wxPython. (that GUI is inconsitent, but never breaks like this. It might be me that have not understood the threading model used by Javascript and Titanium, but I am not alone according to their open discussion forums, GUI objects are suddenly using the wrong context/not updating..???) before that I have a background in C and ASM programming for mobile devices.</p>  <p>[edit - added part with bugs and not being thread safe] [Edit - now having worked with it for a month+, mostly on PC but some on OS X as well. Added iPhone and Android dual targetting. Added Trial and Error debug cycle speed.]</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>278.0</td><td>python-3.x</td></tr><tr><td><p>I inherited a huge code base which was written to work on Windows XP.

The stylus middleware is definitely executing and attempting to do <code>fs.stat</code> on both the <code>.styl</code> file, which exists, and the <code>.css</code> file, which does not yet exist, thus the <code>ENOENT</code>, but the middleware looks like it should detect that <code>ENOENT</code> and handle it without any problems (compile the .styl and save the result in the .css).  But no .css file is being written.  If it was written, the system is designed for the middleware to call <code>next()</code> without actually sending anything in the response, but then the static provide would find the .css file and send it as the response, right?</p>  <p>Anyone know what I've got wrong here?</p> </td><td><express><stylus></td><td>141.0</td><td>mvvm</td></tr><tr><td><p>I am trying to set up roundhouse deployment scripts.

Targeted platform or OS is 2.2... Since it is what my phone uses.</p>  <p>Some code:</p>  <pre><code>bufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(FREQUENCY, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT); audioRecord = new AudioRecord(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC, FREQUENCY, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, bufferSize); </code></pre>  <p>This is the code I use to setup the AudioRecord API with. Now, for the emulator it likes FREQUENCY to be set to 8000 for it to work. Comes back with a buffer size 640. For the phone I use 44100. One issue here is it seems the resulting PCM data for the wave seems to be an eight bit signed wave. I get values from -127 to 128. I thought the value <code>AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT</code> would produce something different.</p>  <p>I process the audio with a thread,</p>  <pre><code>public void run() {   while(isRecording) {     audioRecord.startRecording();     byte[] data = new byte[bufferSize];     audioRecord.read(data, 0, bufferSize);     listener.setData(data);     handleData(data);   }   audioRecord.release(); } </code></pre>  <p>I have a way to graphically display to corresponding wave in real time using a <code>SurfaceView</code>. There seems to be a lot of noise coming from the MIC. I get this noise from the emulator and the phone as well. Do I need to run the data through some sort of filter(s)?

With the new OSX 10.7 Lion, some of the plugins have updated views. PitchShift is one of these. </p>  <p>PitchShift and a few others have new knobs to change there parameters. When a knob is being turned with the mouse, a horizontal bar showing the knob's parameter value is displayed below the knob. </p>  <p>This bar stays on screen after the knob is released and even after the window is closed. If I click one of the knobs, thus creating a rogue value bar, and move the window the PitchShift view is in, the bar stays where the window used to be. And if I click the knob again at this point, a new bar appears, but both bars are actively updated with the changing knob parameter value information. This happens every time I repeat this process with more bars staying on screen.</p>  <p>After a few times with this happening, my app exits with bad access at  NSApplicaionMain() call in the main.m file. </p>  <p>I checked in Logic 9, and this does not happen there. The bar seems to be tied directly to the knob, and thus disappears immediately after you let the knob go with the mouse. </p>  <p>I set the PitchSHift view to be the contentView of a dedicated NSWindow.</p>  <p>How is Logic keeping this from happening, or just how can I? </p>  <p>I've tried seeing if the parameter value bars where subviews of the PitchShift view, but they don't seem to be. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT: When the a value bar first appears, I get the following output in the console from my program: Circle and line do not intersect</p>  <p>So I've found that it is using core-animations CALayers. The problem now is that the value bar layers aren't a part of the PitchShiftView's layer hierarchy.

Note with the other alternative (convert to xhml) anyway you'll need to do this step too.</p>  <p>This alternative has the advantage that you don't need to change your existing navigation rules or page extensions, so from JSF spec point of view this alternative is preferred.</p>  <p>If you have more questions about this you can suscribe to <a href=\"\"http://myfaces.apache.org/mail-lists.html\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">MyFaces Users and Dev Mailing Lists</a> and ask questions there.</p> \"",

I have a script that calls a sp to figure out how much space is required to create an index. (we are using sql express which has max db size limit). Depending on how much space is left it deletes rows from a whole bunch of tables and then creates the index with the usual checks (if not exists in sysindex...create index...). The sp called will be used in other index creation scripts in the future so unless there is no option I would prefer to keep it as a sp and not part of the create index script (inline). Problem is that roundhouse runs my index creation script in the UP folder first and then goes after the sp folder or runfirstafterUp folder. It cannot find the sp since it has not been plugged into the db first. Pls advise if there is any solution to this sequence problem. thanks</p> \"",

Other than a slight readability issue, there's nothing wrong with:</p>  <pre><code>int compfn (const void *p1, const void *p2) {     return strcmp (*((const char **)(p1)), *((const char **)(p2))); } </code></pre>  <hr>  <p><sup>(a)</sup> Subject to the normal rules that the pointers must both point to elements of the same array or one beyond that array - anything else is undefined. I mention that for completeness but, if you're using <code>qsort</code>, you'll be working on an array anyway.</p> ",

It consists of a simple Clustered Index Scan with <strong>14282.3</strong> estimated rows and 15676 actual rows. From what I've learned about statistics and cost estimation, using the two histograms above we can multiply the selectivity of SiteID (16005.02 / 286685) times the selectivity of DeleteDateTime (255827 / 286685) to get a composite selectivity of 0.0498187307480119.

Most of the time 2-3 people might be working on the same websites, but on different sections (chances of conflict are near zero). We don't have any versions or release cycles. A programmer will develop a particular section, after which it will be passed to another person, who will write content for the section and perform SEO. Once it is done, the section will be uploaded to the public website. In the mean time, another programmer might be working on updating an existing section. If a bug or error is reported, it will be fixed and uploaded immediately.</p>  <p>Usually, every week 2-3 new sections are added / updated.</p>  <p>Currently we have only one branch (master) and create a new branch only if the person is working on big change which will take more than 2 weeks to complete.

         "<p>I really tried hard to find a similar issue to get some leads, but no one seems to describe the case we are having, so here it goes.</p>  <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <p>We have a product with the following general design:</p>  <p>[Local installation folder]</p>  <ul> <li>Contains a set of .NET assemblies, implementing the bulk of our product functionality.</li> <li>Example: <em>Implementation1.dll</em>, <em>Implementation2.dll</em></li> </ul>  <p>[GAC]</p>  <ul> <li>ClientAPI.dll. Our client assembly, to be referenced from end user Visual Studio projects. Has strong references to the implementation dll's in the local installation folder.</li> </ul>  <p>In ClientAPI.dll, we have an entrypoint we require end user projects to invoke. Lets call it <code>Initialize()</code>.</p>  <p>The very first thing we do in <code>Initialize</code> is to install a so called <em>assembly resolve handler</em> on the current domain, using the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event. This handler will know how to locate the implementation dll's and load them into the client process, using <code>Assembly.Load()</code>.</p>  <p>Consider a console application. It will look something like:</p>  <pre><code>class Class1 {     void Main(string[] args)     {         ClientAPI.Initialize();          // Use other API's in the assembly, possibly internally referencing the         // implementation classes, that now will be resolved by our assembly         // resolve handler.     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Now, all is good in the console/windows forms/WPF world. Our assembly resolve handler is properly installed and invoked, and it can successfully resolve references to the implementation DLL's once ClientAPI.dll require their functionality.</p>  <p><strong>Problem statement</strong></p>  <p>With that being said, we intend not to support only console or WPF applications, so we were relying on the same design in ASP.NET. Hence, creating a new ASP.NET Web Application project in VS 2010, we figured everything would be as straightforward as:</p>  <pre><code>class Globals : HttpApplication {     void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         ClientAPI.Initialize();          // ...     } } </code></pre>  <p>A few 20-30 hours of dwelling in the ASP.NET runtime universe, trying the above in both the development server and in IIS, we've learned that things there are not really as we expected.</p>  <p>It turns out that in ASP.NET, as soon as the <code>ClientAPI</code> class is referenced anywhere, <em>all references it has to any other assemblies are instantly resolved</em>. And not only that: <em>the results are cached</em> (by design, since .NET 2.0 we've found), meaning we never have a chance at all trying to assist the CLR.</p>  <p>Without further elaboration about the different things we've tried and learned, it basically comes down to this question we have:</p>  <p>Why is ASP.NET resolving references like this? It is not compatible with how other types of applications does it, and even more, it is not according to the documentation of .NET / the CLR runtime, specifying that references to external types / assemblies are to be resolve when first needed (i.e when first used in code).</p>  <p>Any kind of insight/ideas would be highly appreciated!</p> ",

Hey, I've got the OO attributes down, so lets get to the methods :)</p>  <p>Note that I said 'best' way. I've already found two ways of doing it which also seem to be popular answers in similar questions, but they require circumventing strict and warnings respectively.</p>  <p>Note that the example gives the class-user the ability to override the formatting method at construction. Poor example, but you get the idea. To preemptively rebut the OO-purists, this makes more sense in my particular design than making the class-user subclass it with their own overridden version.</p>  <p>Here are my two attempts:</p>  <pre><code>use 5.014; use autodie; use strict; use warnings;  package Account {     use base 'Object::Accessor';      sub new {         my ($type, %args) = @_;          my $self = bless { }, $type;         $self-&gt;mk_accessors(qw(             first_name last_name age_in_years activated         ));          $self-&gt;first_name(  $args{first_name  } // 'Default First Name'  );         $self-&gt;last_name(   $args{last_name   } // 'Default Last Name'   );         $self-&gt;age_in_years($args{age_in_years} // 'Default Age in Years');         $self-&gt;activated(   $args{activated   } // 'Default Activated'   );          {             # Stop skim reading and look here!              no warnings 'once';             *formatted = $args{formatted} || sub {                 return 'Default formatting routine';             };         }          return $self;     } }  my $account = Account-&gt;new; say $account-&gt;formatted;  # Output: Default formatting routine </code></pre>  <p>And the other one:</p>  <pre><code>use 5.014; use autodie; use strict; use warnings;  package Account {     use base 'Object::Accessor';      sub new {         my ($type, %args) = @_;          my $self = bless { }, $type;         $self-&gt;mk_accessors(qw(             first_name last_name age_in_years activated         ));          $self-&gt;first_name(  $args{first_name  } // 'Default First Name'  );         $self-&gt;last_name(   $args{last_name   } // 'Default Last Name'   );         $self-&gt;age_in_years($args{age_in_years} // 'Default Age in Years');         $self-&gt;activated(   $args{activated   } // 'Default Activated'   );          {             # Stop skim reading and look here!              no strict 'refs';             *{'formatted'} = $args{formatted} || sub {                 return 'Default formatting routine';             };         }          return $self;     } }  my $account = Account-&gt;new; say $account-&gt;formatted;  # Output: Default formatting routine </code></pre>  <p>The former approach <strong>should</strong> work without warnings, but it doesn't because Perl thinks I'm not using it anywhere and flags it up as a warning at runtime. The latter doesn't work without circumventing strict, and that's how it should be :)</p>  <p>All I'm doing is assigning a method to a user-supplied coderef. There should be an easy way of doing this.</p>  <p>Note that defining a new sub that calls the user defined coderef doesn't work either, since the lexical %args can't be accessed from it.</p>  <p>Whilst our assigns package variables, it can't do subs.</p>  <p>Refraining the escape from the garden of strict and warnings, what is the cleanest way to do this?

If you call <code>Sleep</code> from the main thread, then the message queue will not be pumped until the timeout elapses.  Hence the entire app appears frozen.</p>  <p>Why does calling <code>Sleep</code> from one form affect another form? Because all GUI components are served from the single message queue of the main thread.  Once you stop pumping that queue, all GUI components stop receiving queued messages like <code>WM_PAINT</code>, <code>WM_KEYDOWN</code> etc.</p>  <p>As I understand it your problem is that your application appears hung when you are loading a 3MB text file into an edit control.  That size of file doesn't sound very large to me and one obvious solution would be to find an edit control that performs the load better.  For example I'm pretty sure that Notepad, Notepad++ etc. do not take steps like showing progress when loading such files. I rather suspect that those apps don't pump the queue when loading files but you just don't notice because of the short time taken.</p>  <p>What you don't want to happen is for you to pump your queue to keep your GUI responsive and in turn allow the user to start loading another file whilst the first one is still loading. You need to disable your UI whilst processing a load operation. A modal progress dialog is one way to do that.</p>  <p>If you can't switch to a better performing control, you could show a modal progress dialog and use a background thread like this. The background thread would have load the file in small chunks, say into a string list. After each chunk of the file was ready it would then call Synchronize and get the main thread to add the contents of the string list to the edit control, and then clear the string list. The thread would then continue and load the next chunk. Adding to the edit control in small chunks would allow you to keep the message queue serviced.</p>  <p>You could show progress in a status bar rather than a modal dialog which would be less intrusive.

The problem is not the red channel however (which ends up as 255 and hence is not affected), so any changes to that will only serve to desaturate the colour even more instead of darkening it.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> To make this a bit more mathmatical, the function that is applied by the transparency of the selection is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>f(x) = 0.4x + 153</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you apply this to all the channels of your colour you will see that this is indeed the case.

For example, a number that is supposed to be 16 occasionally gets mysteriously stored as 16.0000000001 or 15.99999999999 (usually after enduring some operations) with floating point, and this could cause problems when testing for equality (because 16!=15.99999999999).</p>  <p>Is it possible to convert a variable from int to double (the variable, not just its value)? If not, then what else can I do to be able to store the note's length using either an integer or a double, depending on the what I need the type to be?</p> ",

The rest of my application all uses blocking methods, server has a method</p>  <p>Heres what I did:</p>  <p>Server method:</p>  <pre><code>public synchronized void sendFile(File file) {   //send messsage asking if I can send a file   //block on read, waiting for client responde   //if client answers yes, start sending the bytes   //else return } </code></pre>  <p>Client methods:</p>  <pre><code>public void reciveCommand() {    //read/listen for a command from socket    //if is a send file command handleSendFileCommand();    //after the return of handleSendFileCommand() listen for another command }  public void handleSendFileCommand() {    //get the file server want to send    //check if it already has the file    //if it already has, then send a command to the socket saying it already has and return             //else send a command saying server can send the file    //create a FileInputStream, recive bytes and then return method } </code></pre>  <p>I am 100% sure this is wrong because, there is no way server and clients would talk bidirecional, I mean, when server wants to send a command to a server, they have to follow an order of commands until that conversation is finished, only then, they can send/recive another sequence of commands.

         "<p>I have an MS Access 2007 split database. The Back End database (accdb) contains 1 table. It is on a server share. One user who updates the table has full NTFS permissions to the file. Several Front End users have NTFS read access to the file. The Front End database (accdb) contains queries and a link to the Back End database file. Each Front End user has a local copy of the Front End database.</p>  <p>Here is the issue; if the Back End database needs to be updated, and Front End users have the Front End database open – The Back End database is Read Only. If I have all Front End users close their local copy of the database, the Back End database can then be updated. However, if the Back End file is opened, (Being Updated) and Front End users open their local copy of the database – They cannot run queries. </p>  <p>What I am trying to accomplish is Front End users can open their local copy of the database and run queries at anytime, and the Back End database can be opened and updated at anytime. Is there a way to do this? It is very frustrating when the Back End database is being updated, that users cannot run queries - And if Front End users are running queries, the Back End database can only be opened with read only access.</p>  <p>Thanks, Tom </p> ",

If your organization uses certificate chaining, use this format to create CA certificates.</p>      <p><strong>.arm</strong></p>      <p>A file with an extension of .arm contains a base-64 encoded ASCII representation of a certificate, including its public key, but not its private key. An .arm format is generated and used by the IBM® Key Management utility. Specify this format to extract a self-signed certificate from the machine on which the self-signed certificate was generated to the machine that will use the self-signed certificate as the CA certificate.</p>      <p><strong>.der</strong></p>      <p>A file with an extension of .der contains binary data. This format can be used only for a single certificate, unlike a file with a privacy-enhanced mail format, which can contain multiple certificates. Specify this format to extract a self-signed certificate from the machine on which the self-signed certificate was generated to the machine that will use the self-signed certificate as the CA certificate.</p>      <p><strong>.pfx (PKCS12)</strong></p>      <p>A PKCS12 file, which has an extension of .pfx, contains a certificate (CA-issued certificate or self-signed certificate) and a corresponding private key. Use this format to transfer the contents of a keystore to a separate machine. For example, you can create and install a certificate and private key using key management utility, export the certificate and key to a PKCS12 file, then import the file into another keystore. This format is also useful for converting from one type of SSL implementation to a different implementation. For example, you can create and export a PKCS12 file using the IBM Key Management utility, then import the file on another machine using the OpenSSL CertTool utility.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The text above is a verbatim copy from <a href=\"\"http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v5r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itim.infocenter.doc%2Fcpt%2Fcpt_ic_security_ssl_oview_ftypes.html\"\">IBM Eclipse Help</a>.</p> \"",

What happens to the thread at this point? Does control go back to the message loop and the UI thread is free to process other inputs?</p>  <p>When the awaited task completes, does the entire stack get pushed onto a message queue, such that control will return through each of those nested functions, or is something else entirely happening here?</p>  <p>And secondly (while I have your attention), I don't really understand why asynchronous methods need to be labeled with <code>async</code>. Can't any method be executed asynchronously? What if I want to execute a method asynchronously but it doesn't have an async keyword--is there a way to do that simply?</p>  <p>Cheers. :)</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Admittedly if I could get the sample code compiling I could probably just figure that out myself, but for one reason or another I'm running into a block there. What I really want to know is to what extent does a continuation continue... does it freeze the entire call stack, to resume it when the task completes, or does it only go back so far? Does a function itself need to be marked as async in order to support continuation, or (as I asked originally) does it continue the entire call stack?</p>  <p>If it <em>doesn't</em> freeze the entire call stack, what happens when the async await hits a non-async calling function? Does it block there? Wouldn't that defeat the point of await? I hope you can see that I'm missing some understanding here that I hope someone can fill in so I can continue to learn this.</p> ",

My pattern is also trying to anticipate someone not putting in the trailing slash, hence the <code>(/?)</code></p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I should also note that I don't want to create a more general rule - I'm comfortable having to add a rewrite rule for each new client and increasing the <code>S=x</code> number each time.</p>  <p>EDIT (Aug 11), So after a little more puttering this is what my .htaccess is at:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^clientA(/?) /portal/clientA/ [R]  # BEGIN WordPress &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt; RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;  # END WordPress </code></pre>  <p>Needless to say it doesn't work. However, the first part works IF I delete the entire WordPress section. I need them BOTH to work simultaneously. WHAT is it about the WordPress piece that is causing the failure of the first section? I suppose it's the combination of RewriteBase and the very last rule which aliases anything else to /index.php, which frankly is a bit of a bummer. In fact I don't truly understand how that rule could even work in a multisite context, and yet it seems to.</p>  <p>FINAL SOLUTION thanks to LazyOne for the correct answer!

I am working with an existing DAL and trying to integrate NHibernate.  One of the functions of the current DAL is that it allows retrieval of some basic foreign key information as part of the parent record.  Let's say there is a <code>User</code> table and a <code>Region</code> table.  Each user has a foreign key to the region in which they reside.  When displaying user information in a GUI, the region name should be displayed with the user, but other details about the region are not necessary.</p>  <p>In the current DAL, the <code>User</code> domain object has a member of type <code>ForeignKeyReference&lt;Region&gt;</code>.</p>  <pre><code>public class ForeignKeyReference&lt;T&gt; {     public virtual int ForeignKeyID { get; set; }     public virtual string ForeignNaturalKey { get; set; }     public virtual T Reference { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>When the <code>User</code> is retrieved from the database, the primary and natural keys for the <code>Region</code> are also retrieved, and the <code>Reference</code> is set to a proxy object.  I would like to simplify this with NHibernate, but still maintain this functionality.  For example, I would like to remove the <code>ForeignKeyReference&lt;Region&gt;</code> member and just have a <code>Region</code> member which is an NHibernate proxy.  On this proxy, I would like to be able to retrieve the ID and the Name without having to hit the database again.</p> ",

In other words, there is always an implied 'this' parameter that is the object on which the method is called.

Conversely, a type class 'instance' can be defined completely seperate from its associated type...even in another module.</li> <li>A type class allows you to define a 'default' implementation for any of the defined operations. Interfaces are strictly type specifications only, no implementation.</li> </ul>  <p>In general, I think its fair to say that type classes are more powerful and flexible than interfaces. How would you define an interface for converting a string to some value or instance of the implementing type? It's certainly not impossible, but the result would not be intuitive or elegant.

So any time you need to make a change, a new string is created and all the information will be copied to the new string. Stringbuilder works with an array, so when a character needs to change its real easy. But when data needs to be inserted the part behind the insertion needs to be moved and when the characters no longer fit in the array a whole new array needs to be created and the old data gets copied in.</p>  <p>That could be whats happeing, the array inside Stringbuilder keeps growing and old data needs to be copied in every time. For example, if there is space for 4 pages in the Stringbuilder, at some point the Stringbuilder needs to reserve space for (usally double) 8 pages, then needs to copy 4 pages of data.</p>  <p>This could be the reason for the excessive amount of time used.</p>  <p>If you use a stream instead, like Kratz said, the hardware will simply increase the allocated memory for your stream.

Should I / how can I 'build' transactions?</p>  <p>Persistency : I use NHibernate for persistency and this also uses the public property setters of classes. When NHibernate hits the property a lot of bussiness logic is done (which seems unnecessary). Should I use custom setters for NHibernate?</p>  <p>Overal it seems that pushing all logic in the domain model makes the domain model rather complex. Any ideas???</p>  <p>Here's a 'sample' problem (sorry for the crappy tooling i use):</p>  <p><img src=\"\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETywd.png\"\" alt=\"\"enter image description here\"\"></p>  <p>You can see the Project my container and objects below it are reacting to each other by subscribing. Now changes to Network are done via NetworkEditor but this editor has no knowledge of NetworkData. This data might even be defined in a another assembly sometimes. The flow goes from user->NetworkEditor->Network->NetworkData and the all other object interested. This does not seem to scale.</p> \"",

         "<p>The theme I find is that networking code is not really unit testable, and should be isolated from the code you do wish to test (the Player object, for example). To me it seems you have tightly coupled a Player to a ClientConnection, which might make it less testable. I also think that coupling a Player with his connection is probably violating the SRP, since they have very distinct responsibilities.</p>  <p>I've written a system which seems similar to what you wish to acheive, and I done so by linking a player to a connection only via delegates and interfaces. I have a separate World and Server class library, and a third project, Application, which references the two, and creates an instance of Server and World. My Player object is in the World, and a Connection in the Server - these two projects do not reference one another, so you can consider Player without any terms of networking.</p>  <p>The method I use is to make SocketHandler abstract, and implement a concrete handler in the Application project. The handler has a reference to the world object, which can be passed to it on creation. (I do so by means of factory classes -  eg, ClientConnectionFactory (in Application), where the Server knows only of abstract Connections and Factories.)</p>  <pre><code>public class ClientConnectionFactory : IConnectionFactory {     private readonly World world;      public ClientConnectionFactory(World world) {         this.world = world;     }      Connection IConnectionFactory.Create(Socket socket) {         return new ClientConnection(socket, world);     } } </code></pre>  <p>The ClientConnection can then forward the World reference to it's handler, along with any information the handler requires about the Connection itself, such as the Send methods in particular. Here I just pass the Connection object itself to the Handler.</p>  <pre><code>public ClientConnection(Socket socket, World world)     : base(socket) {     this.handler = new ClientHandler(this, world);     ... } </code></pre>  <p>Most of the coordination between the game logic and the networking is then contained inside the ClientHandler, and perhaps any other sister objects it references.</p>  <pre><code>class ClientHandler : SocketHandler {     private readonly Connection connection;     private readonly World world;      public ClientHandler(Connection connection, World world) {         this.connection = connection;         this.world = world;         ...     }      //overriden method from SocketHandler     public override void HandleMessage(Byte[] data) {         ...     } } </code></pre>  <p>The rest involves the ClientHandler creating it's Player object, assigning delegates or interfaces to update actions, and then adding the player to the pool of players in World. Initially I done this with a list of events in Player, which I subscribe to with methods in the ClientHandler (which knows of the Connection), but it turned out that there were dozens of events in the Player object which became a mess to maintain.</p>  <p>The option I went for was to use abstract notifiers in the World project on the player. For example, for movement I would have an IMovementNotifier object in Player. In Application, I would create a ClientNotifier which implements this interface and does the relevant sending of data to the client. The ClientHandler would create the ClientNotifier and pass it to it's Player object.</p>  <pre><code>class ClientNotifier : IMovementNotifier //, ..., + bunch of other notifiers {     private readonly Connection connection;      public ClientHandler(Connection connection) {         this.connection = connection;     }      void IMovementNotifier.Move(Player player, Location destination) {         ...         connection.Send(new MoveMessage(...));     } } </code></pre>  <p>The ClientHandler ctor can be changed to instantiate this notifier.</p>  <pre><code>public ClientHandler(Connection connection, World world) {     this.connection = connection;     this.world = world;     ...     var notifier = new ClientNotifier(this);     this.player = new Player(notifier);     this.world.Players.Add(player); } </code></pre>  <p>So the resulting system is one where ClientHandler is responsible for all incoming messages and events, and ClientNotifier handles all outgoing stuff. These two classes are quite difficult to test as they contain a lot of other crap. Networking can't really be unit tested anyway, but the Connection object in these two classes can be mocked. The World library is entirely unit testable without any consideration of networking components, which is what I wanted to acheive in my design anyway.</p>  <p>It's a big system, and I've not covered much of it here, but hope this can give you some hints. Ask me if you'd like any more specific information on it.</p>  <p>If I could give any more advice, it would be to avoid any static or singletons - they'll come back to bite you. Favour increasing complexity if you need to as an alternative, but document where you need to. The system I have might seem complex to a maintainer, but is well documented. To a user it's particularly simple to use. Main is essentially</p>  <pre><code>var world = new World(); var connectionFactory = new ClientConnectionFactory(world); var server = new Server(settings.LocalIP, settings.LocalPort, connectionFactory); </code></pre> ",

How should a slave client ask/tell my central storage server about file changes? I guess it's not a good idea to periodically transfer the whole file list with metadata to the server.

This suggests to me that actually, the vast, vast majority of your time is not spent in the hash table at all, but in the allocator. The reason that this is an unfair comparison is because your GC will never collect in such a trivial program, giving it an undue performance advantage, and native allocators do significant caching of free memory- but that'll never come into play in such a trivial example, because you've never allocated or deallocated anything and so there's nothing to cache.</p>  <p>Finally, the Boost pool implementation is thread-safe, whereas you never play with threads so the GC can just fall back to a single-threaded implementation, which will be much faster.</p>  <p>I resorted to a hand-rolled, non-freeing non-thread-safe pool allocator and got down to 0.525ms for C++ to 0.45ms for C# (on my machine).

All forms and gui controls you are using should implement some kind of interface (e.g. <code>ISkin</code>). Also your application should have some kind of <code>SkinSelector</code>. This one holds all informations about coloring, fonts, etc and it also gets a reference to the MainForm. Within the constructor it recursively runs through the Controls property of the form and checks if there are any controls implementing your interface (simply using <code>as ISkin</code> and check for <code>null</code>). If it is skinnable, simply set the colors, fonts, etc. of the control as defined within you <code>SkinSelector</code>. Sounds quite easy but the problem is, that you have to derive all gui controls and add your interface to them. So this is not such a complicated thing, but maybe a lot of work. Maybe you can test if Generics can help you out by using a <code>SkinWrapper&lt;T&gt; where T : Control</code> and an extension function like <code>ISkin ToSkinnableControl(this Control control)</code>). But this will only work if you need to change a few common properties, that are the same for all controls. If you need more skin control e.g. for the DataGridView or a ComboBox i think derivement is the only way to help you out.</p> ",

         "<p>I fear that combination of DDD and PropertyChanged/CollactionChanged events might now be the best idea. The problem is, that if you base your logic around these events it is extremely hard to manage the complexity as one PropertyChanged leads to another and another and soon enough you loose control. </p>  <p>Another reason why ProportyChanged events and DDD doesn't exactly fit is that in DDD every business operation should be as explicit as possible. Keep in mind that DDD is supposed to bring technical stuff into the world of business, not the other way around. And basing on the PropertyChanged/CollectionChanged doesn't seem very explicit.</p>  <p>In DDD the main goal is to keep consistency inside aggregate, in other words, you need to model the aggregate in such way, that whatever operation you invoke the aggregate is valid and consistent (if the operation succeeds of course). </p>  <p>If you build your model right that there's no need to worry about 'building' transaction - an operation on aggregate should be a transaction itself.</p>  <p>I don't know how your model looks like, but you might consider moving the responsibilities one level 'up' in the aggregate tree, quite possibly adding additional logical entities in the process, instead of relying on the PropertyChanged events.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>Lets assume you have a collection of payments with statuses and whenever a payment changes, you want to recalculate the total balance of customer orders. Instead of subscribing changes to the payments collection and calling a method on customer when collection changes, you might do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>    public class CustomerOrder     {         public List&lt;Payment&gt; Payments { get; }         public Balance BalanceForOrder { get; }          public void SetPaymentAsReceived(Guid paymentId)         {             Payments.First(p =&gt; p.PaymentId == paymentId).Status = PaymentStatus.Received;             RecalculateBalance();         }     } </code></pre>  <p>You might have noticed, that we recalculate the balance of single order and not the balance of entire customer - and in most cases that's ok as customer belongs to another aggregate and its balance can be simply queried when needed. That is exactly the part that shows this 'consistency only within aggregate' thingy - we don't care about any other aggregate at this point, we only deal with single order. If that's not ok for requirements, then the domain is modeled incorrectly.</p>  <p>My point is, that in DDD there's no single good model for every scenario - you have to understand how the business works to be successful. </p>  <p>If you take a look at the example above, you'll see that there is no need to 'build' the transaction - entire transaction is located in <code>SetPaymentAsReceived</code> method. In most cases, one user action should lead to one particular method on an entity withing aggregate - this method explicitly relates to business operation (of course this method may call other methods).</p>  <p>As for events in DDD, there is a concept of Domain Events, however these are not directly related with PropertyChanged/CollectionChanged technical events. Domain Events indicate the business operations (transactions) that have been completed by an aggregate. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Overal it seems that pushing all logic in the domain model makes the   domain model rather complex</p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course it does as it is supposed to be used for scenarios with complex business logic. However if the domain is modeled correctly then it is easy to manage and control this complexity and that's one of the advantages of DDD.</p>  <p>Added after providing example:</p>  <p>Ok, and what about creating an aggregate root called Project - when you build aggregate root from Repository, you can fill it with NetworkData and the operation might look like this:</p>  <pre><code>    public class Project     {         protected List&lt;Network&gt; networks;         protected List&lt;NetworkData&gt; networkDatas;          public void Mutate(string someKindOfNetworkId, object someParam)         {             var network = networks.First(n =&gt; n.Id == someKindOfNetworkId);             var someResult = network.DoSomething(someParam);              networkDatas.Where(d =&gt; d.NetworkId == someKindOfNetworkId)                 .ToList()                 .ForEach(d =&gt; d.DoSomething(someResult, someParam));         }     } </code></pre>  <p>NetworkEditor would not operate on Network directly, rather through Project using NetworkId. </p> ",

You get the same odd errors (IOError 0 et al) that you do when you try to write non-ASCII UTF-8 sequences directly as byte strings.</p>  <p>Unfortunately UTF-8 is a second-class citizen under Windows. NT's Unicode model was drawn up before UTF-8 existed and consequently you're expected to use two-byte-per-code-unit encodings (UTF-16, originally UCS-2) anywhere you want consistent Unicode. Using byte strings, like many portable apps and languages (such as Python) written with C's <code>stdio</code>, doesn't fit that model.</p>  <p>And rewriting Python to use the Windows Unicode console calls (like WriteConsoleW) instead of the portable C stdio ones doesn't play well with shell tricks like piping and redirecting to a file.

An event always has additional data associated with it, for example whether it comes from a trusted source (user's keyboard rather than JavaScript code).

In the end disallowing redispatching of events turned out to be the best solution. After all, this functionality isn't really required: creating a new event object with identical properties (minus hidden data) isn't exactly hard.</p>  <p>Pretty much all the security issues in this area were related to the file input control.

An extra column is added at the end to identify each row. The matrix table will be useful for other problems as well in the future, as long as it is sufficiently big. </p> ",

What you really seem to be after is if there's a way to partially specialize member functions, like the constructor.

You always have to specialize the entire class. The reason is simple: You have to know the full type of the class first <em>before</em> you even know which member functions exist. Consider the following simple situation:</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename  T&gt; class Bar {   void somefunction(const T&amp;); };  template &lt;&gt; class Bar&lt;int&gt; {   double baz(char, int); }; </code></pre>  <p>Now <code>Bar&lt;T&gt;::somefunction()</code> depends on <code>T</code>, but the function only <em>exists</em> when <code>T</code> is not <code>int</code>, because <code>Bar&lt;int&gt;</code> is an entirely different class.</p>  <p>Or consider even another specialization <code>template &lt;&gt; class Bar&lt;double&gt; : public Zip {};</code> -- even the polymorphic nature of a class can be entirely different in a specialization!</p>  <p>So the only way you can provide <s>specializations</s> new declarations of members, including constructors, is by specializing the entire class.

Throw the single socket it's better to request the images all together at the begin of connection and later send all the images in a serial way one to one, or throw the single socket send a image request get the image reply, after request the second image and get the second reply.</p>  <p>If I use multiple sockets, one socket for each image request I want to have a maximum number of open sockets, may I use an threadpool and use one runnable to manage one image transfer throw one socket?</p>  <p>Thank you again.</p> ",

As each driver can have claims/convictions/medical conditions and each of these has another relationship to claimType/convictionType etc the query is very large.</p>  <p>I'm managing to eager load all the quote screens up to summary using CompiledQuery but when I get to the summary EF fails when trying to eager load the CarRisk as it  has 53 Includes.

I get the feeling that when I last did this with less includes (maybe 25) I get a SQL server error about too many tables being used in the query. I've tried combining the results of the compiled queries into one carRisk but I get an error when trying to set something like CarRisk.CarRiskVehicle = carRiskCarRiskVehicleCompiledQuery.CarRiskVehicle but I get the error \"\"The EntityCollection has already been initialized.

It could be a <code>Task&lt;String, Integer&gt;</code> in which case the adapter's bounds wouldn't match and so it wouldn't be applicable.</p>  <p>(Well, it might be that in this case they are OK because they're consumers, but the compiler can't infer that by itself.  If this <em>is</em> the case, then <code>Task.addTaskListener</code> needs to be declared to take a <code>TaskListener&lt;? super T, ? super V&gt;</code> in order to satisfy the compiler.)</p>  <p>Because of the way the <code>addTaskListener</code> is declared, you need to pass in a listener with the exact same generic bounds.  And this is impossible when you declare them as wildcards, since you have no way to refer back to them later.  What you need to do instead is make the method generic, which is similar to using <code>?</code> wildcards except you're giving them names so you can refer to them later on in the method:</p>  <pre><code>public &lt;T, V&gt; void executeTask(Task&lt;T, V&gt; task, boolean handleException) {     task.addTaskListener(new TaskListener.Adapter&lt;T, V&gt;() {         @Override         public void failed(TaskEvent event) { /* ... */ }     });     getContext().getTaskService().execute(task); } </code></pre>  <p>As for the second part, I have no idea - it looks fine to me as well.  Perhaps this is some misleading error that comes from the raw types, although that seems unlikely since neither generic parameter is involved in the declaration at all.  If the compiler still doesn't like the override after the above changes, then perhaps the problem is somewhere else (like you've accidentally placed the method in the wrong class' scope, etc.)</p> ",

Basically, you want to approach each division in sequence: maintain a set of the best available solutions for the divisions already considered, then add the remaining divisions one by one.</p>  <p>Specifically:  you can combine two option matrices (as described for each division) into a combined option matrix.  The rows and columns for this matrix are all possible sums of the rows and columns of the original matrices, and the payoff entries are the sum of the payoffs in the original matrices.  Note that it is possible for rows and columns to overlap (if two sums end up being the same); in that case you clearly want to use the largest payoff.  Also, you will need to store how each payoff was achieved, so you can eventually report how to achieve the optimum solution.</p>  <p>Note that, if the sizes of the original matrices are A and B, the size of resulting matrix could be O(A*B) in the worst case.  However, you don't need to store any rows or columns that are larger than the total available resources.  Also, as previously noted, rows and columns will be combined if there is more than one way to reach that sum.  Finally, I believe you can drop any matrix entries whose payoffs are no better than other matrix entries that require less resources; the resulting sparse matrices may take much less space and computation to deal with.</p>  <p>In any case, once you've combined all your divisions into one final matrix, report the largest payoff entry as your solution.</p> ",

It is different from the mutual exclusion model that is used by a synchronized block.</p>  <p>The wait-notify or mutual cooperation model is typically used in a producer-consumer scenario where one thread produces events that are consumed by another thread. Well-written implementations will strive to avoid the scenarios where a consumer is starved or the producer overruns the consumer with too many events. To avoid this, you would use the wait-notify protocol where</p>  <ul> <li>the consumer <code>wait</code>s for the producer to produce an event.</li> <li>the producer produces the event and <code>notifies</code> the consumer, and then usually goes to sleep, until it is <code>notified</code> by the consumer.</li> <li>when the consumer is notified of an event, it wakes up, processes the event and the <code>notifies</code> the producer that it has finished processing the event.</li> </ul>  <p>You could have many producers and consumers in this scenario. Acquiring the monitor through the mutual exclusion model, on <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code> is bound to destroy this model, since the producer and the consumer do not perform the waiting explicitly. The underlying threads will be present in either the wait set (used by the wait-notify model) or the entry set (used by the mutual exclusion model) of a monitor. Invoking <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code> signals thread(s) to be moved from the wait set to the entry set of the monitor (where there may be contention for the monitor, among several threads, and not just the recently notified one).</p>  <p>Now, when you want to automatically acquire the monitor on <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code> and <code>notifyAll</code> using the mutual exclusion model, it is usually an indication that you do not need to be using the wait-notify model. This is by inference - you would typically signal other threads, only after doing some work in one thread, i.e. on a change in state. If you are automatically acquiring the monitor and invoking <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyAll</code>, you are merely moving threads from the wait set to the entry set, without any intermediate state in your program, implying that the transition is unnecessary. Quite obviously, the authors of the JVM were aware of this, and have not declared the methods as synchronized.</p>  <p>You can read more about the wait sets and entry sets of monitors in Bill Venner's book - <a href=\"\"http://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/threadsynch.html\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Inside the Java Virtual Machine</a>.</p> \"",

Right now, Spring is still the de facto standard.</p>  <p>Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.   Fool me three times, EJB.</p>  <p>Some will claim that Spring is proprietary.  I would argue that the vendor implementations of the JavaEE specs have been just as proprietary, if not more so.</p>  <p>I went through a major conversion recently of moving a bunch of Java Applications from JBoss to Weblogic.  All of the Spring/Hibernate apps ported with zero modifications, because they had all the libraries they needed built in.  All the apps that used JPA and EJB and JSF were a disaster to port.  Subtle differences in interpretations of JPA, EJB, and JSF between appservers caused all kinds of nasty bugs that took forever to fix.  Even something as simple as JNDI naming was completely different between AppServers.</p>  <p>Spring is an implementation.  JavaEE is a spec.  That is a HUGE difference.  I would prefer to use a spec IF the spec was 100% air-tight and gave absolutely no wiggle room in the way vendors implement that spec.  But the JavaEE spec has never been that.  Maybe JavaEE6 is more air-tight?  I don't know.  The more you can package in your WAR, and the less you depend on AppServer libraries, the more portable your application will be, and that, after all, is the reason I use Java and not Dot-NET.</p>  <p>Even IF the spec was air-tight, it would be nice to be able to upgrade the appserver without having to upgrade all my technology stacks in all my applications along with it.  If I want to upgrade from JBoss 4.2 to JBoss 7.0, I have to consider the impact of the newer version of JSF on all of my applications.

The effect of a cv-qualifier-seq in a function declarator   is not the same as adding cv-qualification on top of the function   type, i.e., it does not create a cv-qualified function type.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I read correctly, you <em>can</em> return a pointer to non const member in a const member function. You just won't be able to call it with a non const object.</p>  <p>A way to forbid the calling is:</p>  <pre><code>private:     struct private_      {         void this_type_does_not_support_comparisons() {}     };  public:     typedef void (private_::*bool_type)() const;      operator bool_type() const     {         return ok_ ? &amp;private_::this_type_does_not_support_comparisons : 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>Pointer to member functions can still be compared for equality. You have to write an <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code> for <code>Testable::bool_type</code> types which trigger an error. Easier to do with the CRTP form of the safe bool idiom since those operators become templates and thus can have an erroneous body.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; class safe_bool_concept {     // Implementation detail of safe bool protected:     ~safe_bool_concept() {}  public:     operator safe_bool() const     {         return static_cast&lt;const T*&gt;(this)-&gt;is_null() ? ...;     } };  struct Foo : safe_bool_concept&lt;Foo&gt; {     ...  private:     friend class safe_bool_concept&lt;Foo&gt;;     bool is_null() const { ... } }; </code></pre>  <p>then you can do (do the same with <code>!=</code>):</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; void operator==(const safe_bool_concept&lt;T&gt;&amp; x, const safe_bool_concept&lt;T&gt;&amp;) {     x.some_private_member(); // invalid, but won't be generated                              // unless safe_bool classes are compared } </code></pre>  <p>This means that the safe bool idiom should be implemented via CRTP if you want to forbid comparisons. Comparisons to zero will still work however.</p>  <p>If you go the non-member function route, you'll have to provide <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> too.</p> ",

         "<p>Amir has made some good points.  Given that I'm currently working on a rebuild/redesign of a very valuable site from scratch, the use of AJAX was something we considered carefully.  While I favour the use of AJAX where possible there are 2 situations in particular where I won't use it or at least, will make sure there's a rock solid fallback.</p>  <p>The first is, unfortunately, Amir's example.  Pages should be loaded with an actual request to the page that serves the full page.  The only place I sometimes don't do this is an admin interface where there are no concerns about SEO.  While Amir does suggest have a fallback where the page wouldn't load via AJAX, this is a case where you're really just increasing the complexity of your site and user experience (either your back button won't be functional or you'll have to also use a library that deals with browser history to keep back/forward function in the AJAX version).</p>  <p>The second situation where I will attempt to always make sure there is a fallback is any kind of form.  Be it for a comment, a calculator or some revenue generating aspect, forms are an important way a user interacts with you site.  Ideally, where possible and appropriate, forms <strong>should</strong> (personal opinion) be done with AJAX.  It generally improves the user experience as you can add nice loading gifs etc...  Good user feedback is a major plus and is much better than a non AJAX version where they just see the browser churning until the page comes up.</p>  <p>That being said, as forms are a major interaction point, you can't afford them breaking so they should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> work without AJAX.  It's not even a matter of the 5% of users (some of which I expect is actually devs testing their sites on production environments :-P ) with javascript disabled.  What if your javascript has an error?  Or maybe you've used a function that doesn't exist in all browsers so again, your javascript errors in some browsers?  In those situations you want your forms to still work so it is vital to make sure they fallback to non AJAX versions.</p>  <p>My advice would be to always build your site to work without AJAX 100% then look for places you feel can be improved by the use of AJAX and add it as a layer on top.  This will help give you the confidence that beneath the javascript, you site is rock solid.</p> ",

One of them might need to Interrupt() the other, but only if the other thread is in th middle of processing data that is related to the object that is affected by the first thread. How can I only Interrupt() the second thread based on certain conditions.</p>  <p>I have been working on a program that spins up two threads for processing socket data and updating the GUI with the information. The two threads (topologyThread and dataThread) handle two different aspects of my application, namely topology change notifications for our wireless sensor network, and data information for receiving and processing data from the wireless sensor network.</p>  <p>When data is coming into the dataThread, it's possible that the network member that the data packet represents has already been removed by the topologyThread and as such should not be processed. So, I was thinking that using the Thread.Interrupt() method would allow me to instantly notify the dataThread of changes to the topology and prevent some of the problems we have seen with trying to update the GUI with data for a network member that is no longer connected. My question is this: How can I tell if the dataThread needs to be interrupted? I don't want it to throw an exception while it's processing data for a network member that is still connected, but I want it to be interrupted if it's in the middle of processing data for a network member that is then disconnected. </p>  <p>Scenario 1:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>dataThread processes data to the end and updates GUI</li> </ul>  <p>Scenario 2:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>Network member has been disconnected so no processing takes place.</li> </ul>  <p>Scenario 3:</p>  <ul> <li>Data comes in on dataThread.  </li> <li>dataThread makes sure network member is still part of the network.</li> <li>dataThread begins processing data</li> <li>topologyThread receives notice that the network member is disconnected and removes it from topology.</li> <li>dataThread tries to update GUI for a network member that is no longer connected.</li> </ul>  <p>It's scenario 3 that I am trying to code for. In our testing, this scenario is where the tree view in the sidebar freezes up and the app has to be killed. But I only need to interrupt the dataThread if the object that is affected by the topologyThread is the one that the dataThread is currently acting on.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading. :)</p> ",

How can I:</p>  <ol> <li>Return the value of call() to the user w/o blocking (I think I need to use a Future for this)</li> <li>Tell the JXLayer to lock (starts painter), execute the supplied callable, and then unlock the JXLayer (stops painter)</li> <li>Ensure that, no matter what thread calls my busyExec() function, the GUI remains responsive and the background task completes. (NOTE: If I return some sort of Future object and they call get() on the event thread, it can/will block and that is ok)</li> </ol>  <p>I guess my main stumbling point is how to implement #2. Should I have busyExec() spin off a new thread that blocks until no background tasks are running? Should I try for some sort of queue. Is there an object that will do this all for me already?</p> ",

However, you will still run into the same problem trying to do what you want to do. Spring has to be able to instantiate the form command object, like it says in the exception you're getting. It cannot instantiate an interface, like it says. You'll have to try a different approach, which will likely involve more work on your part and less help from Spring MVC. You can just work with request parameter values directly and not use a command object. You will have to manually bind the parameters to your correct subclass instance. Or instead you could perhaps try to use a non-abstract base class for your subclasses. That way you could specify that class as the command object and Spring could instantiate it and bind values to it. You could do something similar by having a separate class that models your forms and is not in your existing class hierarchy. You'll have to translate that into your classes, though. You may also want to examine your object model and make sure you're really modeling things correctly. Generally if you are doing something funky that the standard tools don't support you are probably wandering off into bad territoy.</p> ",

         "<p>I'm taking a course in Android/iPhone development and we spent 8 weeks with Titanium (not full time) (Version was Titanium 1.4.2 and time was around November 2010). Here is my experience.</p>  <h2>iPhone Android dual targetting</h2>  <p>Even though the API guides claim that the functionality is available for both the Android and iPhone, this is not the case. Much of the stuff simply don't work on one of the platforms. Some things works differently. </p>  <p>A lot of the people in the class has done iPhone applications, and they can not make them work on Android without major rewrites. I developed a simple childrens app called Animap (see android market / Appstore in Sweden) and started developing under Windows. Once the Android target was working I opened the project on OS X. It does not show any build stuff for iPhone, just for Android. You need to start a dual target project under OS X. (Ok, I copied the relevant files to a new project). Next problem - the animations does not work on iPhone (they work on Android). The scrolling events does not work the same on the iPhone. (i.e on Android you get the untouch event when user stops scrolling and releases their finger from the screen, this does not happen on the iPhone). </p>  <p>Since this is not mentioned somewhere you basicly need to do trial and error programming on first one platform, then on the other platform. By trial and error I mean it will take about two days to get such a simple App as Animap working on the other platform. You will also need to have if (android) then... or if(iphone)... all over your code... </p>  <h2>Download and setup</h2>  <p>You must follow the instructions to the letter.  Do not try to use java 64 bit. It will not compile the KitchenSink 1.4.0 demo application. (1.3 works OK!) You must put files directly on the C drive as long pathnames will make the external program not receiving all command line parameters if they get to long. (Fine for small programs though) 1/3 of the times, the toolchain simply stops and you must press 'launch' again. Then it will probably work... very unreliable.  The simulator will not be found on startup and then you must simply kill of adb.exe with Ctrl+Alt+Delete and retry.</p>  <h2>Network connection</h2>  <p>On a wifi-network you sometimes looses the live connection and Titanium crashes on you (the compile/deploy interface)  If you do not have a working internet connection it will not start as it can not log you in to their servers. </p>  <h2>API</h2>  <p>CSS, HTML and jQuery is a breeze compared to this. Titanium resembles any other old GUI API, and you need to set some properties for every single button/field/etc. Getting a field wrong is just to easy, remembering all the properties that needs to be set? Did you spell it with capital letters at the right place? (as this is not caught by the compiler, but will be seen as a runtime error if you are lucky to test that part)</p>  <p>In Titanium things simply break when you add another view on top of a control or click somewhere else in the GUI. </p>  <h2>Documentation</h2>  <p>Several API pages carry the Android symbol, but will only return a null when you try to create the control. They are not simply available on the Android platform despite the symbols. Sometimes Android is mention to not support a particular method, but then the whole API is missing. </p>  <h2>KitchenSink</h2>  <p>The demo application. Did I mention it does not compile if you put it in your Eclipse project folder because the path gets too long? Must be put on your C drive in the root folder. I currently use a symbolik link (mklink /J ...)</p>  <h2>Undocumented methods</h2>  <p>You must propably use things as label.setText('Hello World') to change a label reliable but this is not documented at all. </p>  <h2>Debugging</h2>  <p>Titanium.API.info('Printouts are the only way to debug');</p>  <h2>Editing</h2>  <p>The APIs are not available in any good format so you can not get ordinary code-completion with help etc. in Eclipse. Aptana please help out!</p>  <h2>Hardware</h2>  <p>It seems that the compiler/tools are not multithreaded so a fast computer with a fast harddrive is a must, as you must do a lot of trial &amp; error. Did I mention the poor documentation? You must try out everything there as you can't trust it!</p>  <h2>Some positive things</h2>  <ul> <li>Open Source</li> <li><p>From previous projects I have promised myself never ever to use closed source again as you can't simply fix things just by throwing hours and manpower at it. Important when you are late in the project and need to deliver for a hard deadline. This is open source and I have been able to see why the tool chain breaks and actually fix it as well. </p></li> <li><p>Bugdatabase</p></li> <li><p>It's also open. You can simply see that your not alone and do a workaround instead of another 4 hours spent on trial&amp;error. </p></li> <li><p>Community</p></li> <li>Seems to be active on their forums. </li> </ul>  <h2>Bugs</h2>  <ul> <li><em>Titanium 1.4 is not threadsafe</em>. That means if you make use of threads (use the url: property in a createWindow call) and program like the threads are working and send events with data back and forth you run into a lot of very, very strange stuff - lost handlers, lost windows, too many events, too few events, etc. etc. This is all dependent on the timing, putting the rows of code in different order might crash or heal your application. Adding a window in another file.js breaks your app.js execution... This also trashes internal datastructures in Titanium, as they sometimes can update internal datastructures in paralell, overwriting a just changed value with something else.</li> </ul>  <p>Much of the problems I have had with Titanium comes from my background on realtime systems like OSE who support hundreds of threads, events and message passing. This is supposed to work in Titanium 1.4 but it simply doesn't do it reliably. </p>  <ul> <li><p>Javascript (which is new to me) dies silently on runtime errors. This also means that small and common bugs, like misspelling a variable name or reading in a null-pointer does not crash when it should so you can debug it. Instead parts of your program just stop working, for instance an eventhandler, because you misplaced/misstyped a character. </p></li> <li><p>Then we have more simple bugs in Titanium, like some parameters not working in the functions (which is quite common on the Android platform at least). </p></li> <li><p>Trial and Error debug cycle speed Having run Titnium Developer on several computers, I noticed that the bottleneck is the harddrive. An SSD drive on a laptop makes the build cycle about 3-5 times faster than on a 4200 rpm drive. On a desktop, having dual drives in RAID 1 (striping mode) makes the build about 25 percent faster than on a single drive with a somewhat faster CPU and it also beats the SSD drive laptop. </p></li> </ul>  <h2>Summary</h2>  <ul> <li>From the comments in this thread there seems to be a fight for the number of platforms a tool like this can deliver app's for. The number of API seems to be the key selling-point. </li> </ul>  <p>This shines through very much when you start using it. If you look at the open bugtracker you see that the number of bugs keeps increasing faster than the number of fixed bugs. This is usually a sign that the developers keep adding more functionality, rather than concentrating on getting the number of bugs down. </p>  <p>As a consultant trying to deliver rather simple apps to multiplatforms for a customer - I'm not sure this is actually faster than doing native app development on two platforms. This is due to the fact that when you are up to speed you are fast with Titanium, but then suddenly you look down and find yourself in a hole so deep you don't know how many hours must be spent for a workaround. You can simply NOT promise a certain functionality for a certain deadline/time/cost. </p>  <p>About myself: Been using Python for two years with wxPython. (that GUI is inconsitent, but never breaks like this. It might be me that have not understood the threading model used by Javascript and Titanium, but I am not alone according to their open discussion forums, GUI objects are suddenly using the wrong context/not updating..???) before that I have a background in C and ASM programming for mobile devices.</p>  <p>[edit - added part with bugs and not being thread safe] [Edit - now having worked with it for a month+, mostly on PC but some on OS X as well. Added iPhone and Android dual targetting. Added Trial and Error debug cycle speed.]</p> ",
